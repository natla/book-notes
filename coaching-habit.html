		<p>The change of behaviour at the heart of what this book is about is this: a little more asking people questions and a little less telling people what to do. </p>

<p>Have you heard the one that says that if you do something for twenty-one days, you&rsquo;ll have a new habit?
Someone just made that up...</p>

<p>To build an effective new habit, you need five essential components: a reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan.</p>

<div class="important">
<p> So think less about what your habit can do for you, and more about how this new habit will help a person or people you care about.</p>
</div>

<p>if you don&rsquo;t know what triggers the old behaviour, you&rsquo;ll never change it because you&rsquo;ll already be doing it before you know it. </p>

<p>Practicing small chunks of the bigger action (for instance, rather than practice the whole tennis serve, you practice just tossing the ball up). Repetition, repetition and repetition&#8230; and repetition. Do it fast, do it slow, do it differently. But keep repeating the action. And finally, being mindful and noticing when it goes well. When it does, celebrate success. You don&rsquo;t have to go buy the bottle of M&ouml;et, although you can if you wish. A small fist pump will do just fine.</p>

<p>Resilient systems build in fail-safes so that when something breaks down, the next step to recover is obvious.<br />
Make your habit a resilient system.</p>

<p>There are three parts to the formula: identifying the trigger, identifying the old habit and defining the new behaviour.</p>

<p> Charles Duhigg says that there are just five types of triggers: location, time, emotional state, other people, and the immediately preceding action. </p>

<h3> The Kickstart Question: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on Your Mind?&rdquo;</h3>

<p>hearts beating fast. It&rsquo;s a question that says, Let&rsquo;s talk about the thing that matters most. </p>

<p> Some institutions distinguish between coaching for performance and coaching for development. Coaching for performance is about addressing and fixing a specific problem or challenge. It&rsquo;s putting out the fire or building up the fire or banking the fire.</p>

<p>Coaching for development is about turning the focus from the issue to the <i>person</i> dealing with the issue, the person who&rsquo;s managing the fire. </p>

<p> Call them forward to learn, improve and grow, rather than to just get something sorted out.</p>

			    <p>ANSWERS ARE CLOSED ROOMS; AND QUESTIONS ARE OPEN DOORS THAT INVITE US IN.</p> <p class="author">Nancy Willard</p>
</blockquote>

<p> When you&rsquo;re talking about people, though, you&rsquo;re not really talking about them. You&rsquo;re talking about a relationship and, specifically, about what your role is in this relationship that might currently be less than ideal.</p>

<h4>Putting the 3Ps to Use</h4> <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; you ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The [insert name of thing they&rsquo;re working on],&rdquo; they say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are three different facets of that we could look at,&rdquo; you offer. &ldquo;The project side&mdash;any challenges around the actual content. The people side&mdash;any issues with team members/ colleagues/ other departments/ bosses/ customers/ clients. And patterns&mdash;if there&rsquo;s a way that you&rsquo;re getting in your own way, and not showing in the best possible way. Where should we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which one they pick&mdash;it will be a strong start to the conversation. And when they&rsquo;re done discussing that P, you can just take them to one of the other two Ps and ask, &ldquo;If this was a thing, what would the challenge here be for you?&rdquo; And you&rsquo;ll likely have a deeper, more robust and richer conversation.</p>

<p>...we are what we give our attention to. </p>

<h3> The AWE Question: &ldquo;And What Else?&rdquo;</h3>

<p>But &ldquo;And What Else?&rdquo;&mdash;the AWE Question&mdash;has magical properties. With seemingly no effort, it creates more&mdash;more wisdom, more insights, more self-awareness, more possibilities&mdash;out of thin air. There are three reasons it has the impact that it does: more options can lead to better decisions; you rein yourself in; and you buy yourself time.</p>
<p>He then looked at the success rate of decisions that involved more choices. For instance, what would happen if you added just one more option: Should we do this? Or this? Or not? The results were startling. Having at least one more option lowered the failure rate by almost half, down to about 30 percent.</p>
<p>When you use &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll get more options and often better options. <em>Better options lead to better decisions.</em> Better decisions lead to greater success.</p>

<div class="important">
<p> Tell less and ask more. Your advice is not as good as you think it is.</p>
</div>

<p>...even though we don&rsquo;t really know what the issue is, or what&rsquo;s going on for the person, we&rsquo;re quite sure we&rsquo;ve got the answer she needs.</p>

<p> &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo; That version of &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; invites closure, while still leaving the door open for whatever else needs to be said.</p>
<p> Science has whittled that number down over time, so now it&rsquo;s generally assumed that four is actually the ideal number at which we can chunk information. In some ways, it&rsquo;s as if our unconscious brain counts like this: one, two, three, four&#8230; lots.</p>
<p>When people start talking to you about the challenge at hand, what&rsquo;s essential to remember is that what they&rsquo;re laying out for you is rarely the actual problem. And when you start jumping in to fix things, things go off the rails in three ways: you work on the wrong problem; you do the work your team</p>

<h4>You&rsquo;re Solving the Wrong Problem</h4>
<p>You might have come up with a brilliant way to fix the challenge your team is talking about. However, the challenge they&rsquo;re talking about is most likely not the real challenge that needs to be sorted out. They could be describing any number of things: a symptom, a secondary issue, a ghost of a previous problem which is comfortably familiar, often even a half-baked solution to an unarticulated issue.</p>

<h3>The Focus Question: What&rsquo;s the Real Challenge Here for You?</h3>

<p> &ldquo;If you had to pick one of these to focus on, which one here would be the real challenge for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p> You can take this insight and add it to all of the questions you ask people. Adding <em>&ldquo;for you&rdquo;</em> to a question helps people figure out the answers faster and more accurately.</p>

<p>Stick to questions starting with &ldquo;What&rdquo; and avoid questions starting with &ldquo;Why.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no accident that six of the Seven Essential Questions are What questions.</p>

<div class="important">
<p>Reframe the question so it starts with &ldquo;What.&rdquo; So, as some examples, instead of &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;What were you hoping for here?&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;Why did you think this was a good idea?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;What made you choose this course of action?&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;Why are you bothering with this?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important for you here?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>...coaching conversation. You&rsquo;ll be surprised and delighted at just how often these are exactly the right questions to ask. Open with: What&rsquo;s on your mind? The perfect way to start; the question is open but focused. Check in: Is there anything else on your mind? Give the person an option to share additional concerns. Then begin to focus: So what&rsquo;s the real challenge here for you? Already the conversation will deepen. Your job now is to find what&rsquo;s most useful to look at. Ask: And what else (is the real challenge here for you)? Trust me, the person will have something. And there may be more. Probe again: Is there anything else? You&rsquo;ll have most of what matters in front of you now. So get to the heart of it and ask:</p>
<p>So . . . what&rsquo;s the real challenge here for you?</p>

<h3>The Foundation Question: &ldquo;What Do You Want?&rdquo;</h3>

<p> But even if you know what you want and are courageous enough to ask for what you want, it&rsquo;s often hard to say it in a way that&rsquo;s clearly heard and understood. Sometimes the responsibility for that rests with you. You&rsquo;ve found a way to hide what you want under layers of rhetoric; or been distracted from what you really want with various other, less important hopes; or trusted that the heavy hints you&rsquo;d made were sufficient...</p>

<blockquote class="important"><p>&ldquo;The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The illusion that both parties to the conversation know what the other party wants is pervasive, and it sets the stage for plenty of frustrating exchanges. Not all is lost, though. One of the ways to ensure smoother sailing is to understand the difference between wants and needs.</p>

<p>Want: I&rsquo;d like to have this.</p>
<p>Need: I must have this.</p>

<p>Needs go deeper, and identifying them helps you pull back the curtain to understand the more human driver who might be behind the want. Drawing on the work of economist Manfred Max-Neef, Rosenberg says that there are nine self-explanatory universal needs.</p>

<p>...listen to see if you can guess the need that likely lies behind the person&rsquo;s request.</p>

<p>Five times a second, at an unconscious level, your brain is scanning the environment around you and asking itself: Is it safe here? Or is it dangerous?</p>

<p> When your brain feels safe, it can operate at its most sophisticated level.</p>

<p>There are four primary drivers&mdash;they spell out the acronym TERA&mdash;that influence how the brain reads any situation.</p>

<p>T is for tribe. The brain is asking, &ldquo;Are you with me, or are you against me?&rdquo; If it believes that you&rsquo;re on its side, it increases the TERA Quotient. If you&rsquo;re seen as the opposition, the TERA Quotient goes down. E is for expectation. The brain is figuring out, &ldquo;Do I know the future or don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; If what&rsquo;s going to happen next is clear, the situation feels safe. If not, it feels dangerous. R is for rank. It&rsquo;s a relative thing, and it depends not on your formal title but on how power is being played out in the moment. &ldquo;Are you more important or less important than I am?&rdquo; is the question the brain is asking, and if you&rsquo;ve diminished my status, the situation feels less secure. A is for autonomy. Dan Pink talks about the importance of this in his excellent book <cite>Drive.</cite> &ldquo;Do I get a say or don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the question the brain is asking as it gauges the degree of autonomy you have in any situation. If you believe you do have a choice, then this environment is more likely to be a place of reward and therefore engagement. If you believe you don&rsquo;t have choice so much, then it becomes less safe for you.</p>

<p><em>Silence</em> is often a measure of success.</p>

<p> In either case, it means he&rsquo;s thinking, searching for the answer. He&rsquo;s creating new neural pathways, and in doing so literally increasing his potential and capacity.</p>
<p>Bite your tongue, and don&rsquo;t fill the silence. I know it will be uncomfortable, and I know it creates space for learning and insight.</p>

<h4> Victim</h4> <p>The core belief: &ldquo;My life is so hard; my life is so unfair. &lsquo;Poor me.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dynamic: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault (it&rsquo;s theirs).&rdquo; </p>
<p>The benefits of playing the role: You have no responsibility for fixing anything; you get to complain; you attract Rescuers.</p>
<p>The price paid for playing the role: You have no sense of being able to change anything&mdash; any change is outside your control. You&rsquo;re known to be ineffective. And no one likes a whiner.</p>
<p> Stuck is: &ldquo;I feel stuck because I have no power and no influence. I feel useless.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Persecutor</h4>
<p>The core belief: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surrounded by fools, idiots or just people less good than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dynamic: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault (it&rsquo;s yours).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of playing the role: You feel superior and have a sense of power and control.</p>
<p>The price paid for playing the role: You end up being responsible for everything. You create Victims. You&rsquo;re known as a micromanager. People do the minimum for you and no more. And no one likes a bully.</p>
<p>Stuck is: &ldquo;I feel stuck because I don&rsquo;t trust anyone. I feel alone.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Rescuer</h4>
<p>The core belief: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight, don&rsquo;t worry, let me jump in and take it on and fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dynamic: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault/responsibility (not yours).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of playing the role: You feel morally superior; you believe you&rsquo;re indispensable.</p>
<p>The price paid for playing the role: People reject your help. You create Victims and perpetuate the Drama Triangle. And no one likes a meddler.</p>
<p>Stuck is: &ldquo;I feel stuck because my rescuing doesn&rsquo;t work. I feel burdened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These three labels aren&rsquo;t descriptions of who you are. They&rsquo;re descriptions of how you&rsquo;re behaving in a given situation. No one is inherently a Victim or a Persecutor or a Rescuer. They are roles we end up playing when we&rsquo;ve been triggered and, in that state, find a less-than-effective version of ourselves playing out.</p>

<p>When we&rsquo;re in Rescuer mode, we&rsquo;re constantly leaping in to solve problems, jumping in to offer advice, taking over responsibilities that others should rightfully keep for themselves. We do it with good intentions; we&rsquo;re just trying to help, to &ldquo;add value&rdquo; as managers.</p>

<h3>The Lazy Question: How Can I Help?</h3>

<p>A way to soften this question, as with all questions, is to use the phrase &ldquo;Out of curiosity.&rdquo; What that does is shift the question from perhaps coming across as an inquisition to being a more noble inquiry. Other phrases that can have a similar softening effect on the question being asked are &ldquo;Just so I know&#8230;&rdquo; or &ldquo;To help me understand better&#8230;&rdquo; or even &ldquo;To make sure that I&rsquo;m clear&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="important"><p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>...create a &ldquo;third point&rdquo;&mdash;an object that you can identify as the thing you&rsquo;re saying No to, which isn&rsquo;t the person. For instance, if you write down someone&rsquo;s request on a bit of paper or a flip chart, you can then point to it and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have to say No to this,&rdquo; which is a little better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have to say No to you.&rdquo; Say Yes to the person, but say No to the task.</p>

<p> What is our winning aspiration? Framing the choice as &ldquo;winning&rdquo; rules out mediocrity as an option. If you want to win, you need to know what game you&rsquo;re playing and with (and against) whom. What impact do you want to have in and on the world? Where will we play? &ldquo;Boiling the ocean&rdquo; is rarely successful. Choosing a sector, geography, product, channel and customer allows you to focus your resources. How will we win? What&rsquo;s the defendable difference that will open up the gap between you and the others? What capabilities must be in place? Not just what do you need to do, but how will it become and stay a strength? What management systems are required? <em>It&rsquo;s easy enough to measure stuff. It&rsquo;s much harder to figure out what you want to measure that actually matters.</em></p>

<p>Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel prize in economics in 2002 for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making, and the field more generally known as behavioural economics. He&rsquo;s best known for his book <cite>Thinking, Fast and Slow</cite>...

<p>This isn&rsquo;t about judging people; it&rsquo;s about encouraging them and letting them know that you listened and heard what they said. Some of my favourite replies are:<br />
FANTASTIC. I LIKE IT. GOOD ONE. NICE. YES, THAT&rsquo;S GOOD. MMM-HMMM</p>

<div class="important">
<p>People don&rsquo;t really learn when you tell them something. They don&rsquo;t even really learn when they do something.<br />
They start learning, start creating new neural pathways, only when they have a chance to recall and reflect on what just happened.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Learning Question: &ldquo;What Was Most Useful for You?&rdquo;</h3>

<div class="important">
<p>Your job as a manager and a leader is to help create the space for people to have those learning moments.</p>
</div>
<p>And to do that, you need a question that drives this double-loop learning. That question is, &ldquo;What was most useful for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>we know how to make the learning experience more successful, thanks to insights from neuroscience and psychology. Josh Davis and colleagues from the NeuroLeadership Institute have created the AGES model to explain the four main neurological drivers of longer-term memory. &ldquo;AGES&rdquo; stands for Attention, Generation, Emotion and Spacing. What&rsquo;s useful here for us is the G: Generation. This is &ldquo;the act of creating (and sharing) your own connections to new and presented ideas&#8230; When we take time and effort to generate knowledge and find answer rather than just reading it, our memory retention is increased.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Less, rather than more, is often better when you&rsquo;re giving feedback. If you list twelve things that could be improved, everyone moves into overwhelm mode. More effective is finding the OBT&mdash;the One Big Thing&mdash; that&rsquo;s worth remembering.</p>

<strong>It Makes It Personal</strong> <p>Adding &ldquo;for you&rdquo; to the question takes it from the abstract to the personal, from the objective to the subjective. Now you&rsquo;re helping people create new neural pathways. And of course, people are telling themselves what was useful, rather than your telling them what you think should be most useful. The former will always sound like better advice.</p>
<strong>It Gives You Feedback</strong> <p>Listen to the answer you get, because it&rsquo;s useful not just for the coachee but for you as well. It will give you guidance on what to do more of next time, and it will reassure you (if you need it) that you&rsquo;re being useful even when you&rsquo;re not giving advice but are asking questions instead. </p>
<strong>It&rsquo;s Learning, Not Judgment</strong> <p>You&rsquo;ll notice that you&rsquo;re not asking, &ldquo;Was this useful?&rdquo; That question sets up a Yes/No answer, and it doesn&rsquo;t actually prompt insight; it just elicits judgment. &ldquo;What was most useful?&rdquo; forces people to extract the value from the conversation. </p>
