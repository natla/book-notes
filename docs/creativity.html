<p>If we made something that <i>we</i> wanted to see, others would want to see it, too.</p>

<p>There was, in short, plenty to occupy my working hours. But my internal sense of purpose&mdash;the thing that had led me to sleep on the floor of the computer lab in graduate school just to get more hours on the mainframe, that kept me
  awake at night, as a kid, solving puzzles in my head, that fueled my every workday&mdash;had gone missing. I&rsquo;d spent two decades building a train and laying its track. Now, the thought of merely driving it struck me as a far less
  interesting task.&#160;</p>

<p>I would devote myself to learning how to build not just a successful company but a sustainable creative culture.</p>

<p>This book isn&rsquo;t just for Pixar people, entertainment executives, or animators. It is for anyone who wants to work in an <em>environment that fosters creativity and problem solving</em>. My belief is that good leadership can help
  creative people stay on the path to excellence no matter what business they&rsquo;re in. My aim at Pixar&#8230; has been to enable our people to do their best work. We start from the presumption that our people are talented and want to
  contribute. We accept that, without meaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways. Finally, we try to identify those impediments and fix them. I&rsquo;ve spent nearly forty years thinking about how to help smart,
  ambitious people work effectively with one another. The way I see it, my job as a manager is to create a fertile environment, keep it healthy, and watch for the things that undermine it. I believe, to my core, that everybody has the
  potential to be creative&mdash;whatever form that creativity takes&mdash;and that to encourage such development is a noble thing. More interesting to me, though, are the blocks that get in the way, often without us noticing, and hinder the
  creativity that resides within any thriving company.</p>

<p>I believe the best managers acknowledge and make room for what they do not know&mdash;not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur. I believe that managers
  must loosen the controls, not tighten them. They must accept risk; they must trust the people they work with and strive to clear the path for them; and always, they must pay attention to and engage with anything that creates fear. Moreover,
  successful leaders embrace the reality that their models may be wrong or incomplete. Only when we admit what we don&rsquo;t know can we ever hope to learn it</p>

<h3>PART I <br />GETTING STARTED</h3>

<p>So when problems arise&mdash;and they always do&mdash;disentangling them is not as&#160;simple as correcting the original error. Often, finding a solution is a multi-step endeavor. There is the problem you know you are trying to
  solve&mdash;think of that as an oak tree&mdash;and then there are all the other problems&mdash;think of these as saplings&mdash;that sprouted from the acorns that fell around it. And these problems remain after you cut the oak tree down.
</p>

<p>For me, the key to solving these problems is finding ways to see what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t, which sounds a lot simpler than it is. Pixar today is managed according to this principle, but in a way I&rsquo;ve been searching
  all my life for <em>better ways of seeing</em>.</p>

<p>Sutherland and Dave Evans, who was chair of the university&rsquo;s computer science department, were magnets for bright students with diverse interests, and they led us with a light touch. Basically, they welcomed us to the program, gave
  us workspace and access to computers, and then let us pursue whatever turned us on. The result was a collaborative, supportive community so inspiring that I would later seek to replicate it at Pixar.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>In many respects, my fellow students were the most inspirational part of my university experience; this collegial, collaborative atmosphere was vital not just to my enjoyment of the program but also to the quality of the work that I
    did.</h3>
</div>

<p>This tension between the individual&rsquo;s personal creative contribution and the leverage of the group is a dynamic that exists in all creative environments, but this would be my first taste of it. On one end of the spectrum, I noticed,
  we had the genius who seemed to do amazing work on his or her own; on the other end, we had the group that excelled precisely because of its multiplicity of views. How, then, should we balance these two extremes, I wondered.</p>

<p>ARPA&rsquo;s mandate&mdash;to support smart people in a variety of areas&mdash;was carried out based on the unwavering presumption that researchers would try to do the right thing and, in ARPA&rsquo;s view, overmanaging them was
  counterproductive. ARPA&rsquo;s administrators did not hover over the shoulders of those of us working on the projects they funded, nor did they demand that our work have direct military applications. They simply trusted us to innovate.</p>

<p>For the first time, I saw a way to simultaneously create art <i>and</i> develop a technical understanding of how to create a new kind of imagery. Making pictures with a computer spoke to both sides of my brain.</p>

<p>Instead, they tried to tempt me into taking a job with what is now called Disney Imagineering, the division that designs the theme parks. It may sound odd, given how large Walt Disney had always loomed in my life, but I turned the offer
  down without hesitation. The theme park job felt like a diversion that would lead me down a path I didn&rsquo;t want to be on. I didn&rsquo;t want to design rides for a living. I wanted to animate with a computer.</p>

<p>The leaders of my department understood that to create a fertile laboratory, they had to assemble different kinds of thinkers and then encourage their autonomy. They had to offer feedback when needed but also had to be willing to stand
  back and give us room. I felt instinctively that this kind of environment was rare and worth reaching for. I knew that the most valuable thing I was taking away from the U of U was the model my teachers had&#160;provided for how to lead and
  inspire other creative thinkers. The question for me, then, was how to get myself into another environment like this&mdash;or how to build one of my own.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2 <br />PIXAR IS BORN</h3>

<p>To ensure that it succeeded, I needed to attract the sharpest minds; to attract the sharpest minds, I needed to put my own insecurities away. The lesson of ARPA had lodged in my brain: <em>When faced with a challenge, get smarter.</em></p>

<p>&#8230;I&rsquo;ve made a policy of trying to hire people who are smarter than I am. The obvious payoffs of exceptional people are that they innovate, excel, and generally make your company&mdash;and, by extension, you&mdash;look good. But
  there is another, less obvious, payoff that only occurred to me in retrospect. The act of hiring Alvy changed me as a manager: By ignoring my fear, I learned that the fear was groundless. Over the years, I have met people who took what
  seemed the safer path and were the lesser for it. By hiring Alvy, I had taken a risk, and that risk yielded the highest reward&mdash;a brilliant, committed teammate. I had wondered in graduate school how I could ever replicate the singular
  environment of the U of U. Now, suddenly, I saw the way. Always take a chance on better, even if it seems threatening.</p>

<p>&#8230;any hard problem should have many good minds simultaneously trying to solve it.</p>
