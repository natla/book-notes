<p>If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if you no longer want to add to the residue of past pain that still lives on in you, then don't create any more time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with the
  practical aspects of your life.&#160;&#160;How to stop creating time?&#160;&#160;Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.&#160;&#160;Make the Now the primary focus of your life.&#160;&#160;Whereas before you dwelt in
  time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation.</p>

<p>Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it.&#160; Always work with it, not against it.&#160; Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy.&#160; This will miraculously transform your whole life.</p>

<p>Pain can only feed on pain.&#160;&#160;Pain cannot feed on joy.<br />
  Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain.&#160;&#160;You become a victim or a perpetrator.&#160;&#160;You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both.&#160;&#160;There isn't really much difference between the
  two.&#160;&#160;You are not conscious of this, of course, and will vehemently claim that you do not want pain.&#160;&#160;But look closely and you will find that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself
  and others.&#160;&#160;If you were truly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve&#8230;</p>

<p>Let me summarize the process.&#160;&#160;Focus attention on the feeling inside you.&#160;&#160;Know that it is the pain-body.&#160;Accept that it is there.&#160;&#160;Don't&#160;think&#160;about it -- don't let the feeling turn into
  thinking.&#160;&#160;Don't judge or analyze.&#160;Don't make an identity for yourself out of it.&#160;&#160;Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you.&#160;&#160;Become aware not only of the emotional
  pain but also of &quot;the&#160;one&#160;who&#160;observes,&quot;&#160;the silent watcher.&#160;&#160;This is the power of the Now, the power of your own conscious presence.&#160;&#160;Then see what happens.</p>

<p>For many women, the pain-body awakens particularly at the time preceding the menstrual flow.&#160;&#160;&#8230;If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and&#160;watch&#160;whatever you feel within, rather than be taken over
  by it, it affords an opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all past pain becomes possible.</p>

<p>This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance to&#160;disidentifying&#160;from your pain.&#160;&#160;This will be the case particularly if you have lived closely identified with your emotional pain-body for most of
  your life and the whole or a large part of your sense of self is invested in it.&#160;&#160;What this means is that you have made an unhappy self out of your pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you are.&#160;&#160;In
  that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any&#160;disidentification.&#160;&#160;In other words, you would rather be in pain -- be the pain-body -- than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing
  the familiar unhappy self.&#160;<br />
  If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself.&#160;&#160;Observe the attachment to your pain.&#160;&#160;Be very alert.&#160;&#160;Observe the peculiar pleasure you derive from being unhappy.&#160;&#160;Observe the
  compulsion to talk or think about it.&#160;&#160;The resistance will cease if you make it conscious.&#160;&#160;You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay present as the witness, and so initiate its transmutation.</p>

<p>This is the end of all arguments and power games, which are so corrosive to relationships.&#160;Power over others is weakness disguised as strength.&#160;&#160;True power is within, and it is available to you now.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the&#160;egoic&#160;mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole.&#160;&#160;In some people, this is conscious, in others
  unconscious.&#160;&#160;If it is conscious, it manifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being worthy or good enough.&#160;&#160;If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as an intense craving, wanting and
  needing.&#160;&#160;In either case, people will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within.&#160;&#160;So they strive after possessions, money, success,
  power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete.&#160;&#160;But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it is
  bottomless.&#160;</p>

<p>Death is a stripping away of all that is not you.&#160;&#160;The secret of life is to &quot;die before you die&quot; -- and find that there is no death.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced, done, thought, or felt anything outside the Now?&#160;&#160;Do you think you ever will?&#160;&#160;Is it possible for anything to happen or&#160;be&#160;outside the Now?&#160;&#160;The answer is obvious, is it
  not?&#160;&#160;Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now.&#160;&#160;Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.&#160;&#160;What you think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in the mind, of a
  former&#160;Now.&#160;&#160;&#8230; The future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind.&#160;When the future comes, it comes as the Now.&#160;&#160;When you think about the future, you do it now.&#160;&#160;Past and future obviously
  have no reality of their own.&#160;</p>

<h4>LETTING GO OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME</h4>
<p>For example, if you made a mistake in the past and learn from it now, you are using clock time.&#160;&#160;On the other hand, if you dwell on it mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up, then you are making the mistake into
  &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;: you make it part of your sense of self, and it has become psychological time, which is always linked to a false sense of identity.&#160;&#160;Nonforgiveness&#160;necessarily implies a heavy burden of
  psychological time.<br />
  &#160;<br />
  If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time.&#160;&#160;You are aware of where&#160;you&#160;want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention to the step that you are taking at this moment.&#160;&#160;If
  you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored.&#160;&#160;It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the
  future, with no intrinsic value.&#160;&#160;Clock time then turns into psychological time.&#160;&#160;Your life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain,&#160;to&#160;&quot;make it.&quot; You no
  longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are present in the Now.</p>

<p><i>I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am completely free of my problems.</i><br />
  You are right.&#160;&#160;You can never&#160;reach&#160;that point because you&#160;are&#160;at that point&#160;now.</p>

<p>Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to your&#160;life.&#160;<br />
  <i>What is the&#160;difference?</i><br />
  Your life situation exists in time.&#160;<br />
  Your life is now.&#160;<br />
  Your life situation is mind-stuff.&#160;<br />
  Your life is real.<br />
  &#160;<br />
  Find the &quot;narrow gate that leads to life.&quot; It is called the Now.&#160;&#160;Narrow your life down to this moment.&#160;&#160;Your life situation may be full of problems -- most life situations are -- but find out if you have any
  problem at this moment.&#160;&#160;Not tomorrow or in ten minutes, but now.&#160;&#160;Do you have a problem now?
</p>

<p>When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to enter, no room for a solution.&#160;&#160;So whenever you can, make some room, create some space, so that you find the life underneath your life situation.</p>

<p>It's about realizing that there&#160;are&#160;no problems.&#160;&#160;Only situations -- to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the &quot;isness&quot; of the present moment until they change or can be dealt with.
</p>

<p>Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action wilt be clear and incisive if it arises out of present-moment awareness.&#160;&#160;It is also more likely to be effective.&#160;&#160;It will not be a reaction coming
  from the past conditioning of your mind but an intuitive response to the situation.&#160;&#160;In other instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, you will find it more effective to do nothing -- just stay centered in the Now.
</p>

<p>To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion.&#160;&#160;Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing?&#160;&#160;If there isn't, then time is
  covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle.</p>

<p>As far as your life situation is concerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired.&#160;That's the world of form, of gain and loss.&#160;&#160;Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you realize that, there is a
  playful, joyous energy behind what you do.&#160;&#160;Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become someone.&#160;Nor will you remain
  inactive through fear of failure, which to the ego is loss of self.</p>

<h4>MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW</h4>

<p>When every cell of your body is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every moment as the joy of&#160;Being, then it can be said that you are free of time.</p>

<p>To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need&#160;of&#160;past for your identity and future for your fulfillment.&#160;[&#1076;&#1072; &#1085;&#1077; &#1095;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1080;&#1096;
  &#1080;&#1076;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;&#1080;&#1095;&#1085;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1090;&#1072; &#1089;&#1080; &#1086;&#1090; &#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;&#1083;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086; &#1080;
  &#1091;&#1086;&#1074;&#1083;&#1077;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;&#1090;&#1086; - &#1086;&#1090; &#1073;&#1098;&#1076;&#1077;&#1097;&#1077;&#1090;&#1086;] It represents the most profound transformation of
  consciousness that you can imagine.&#160;&#160;In some rare cases, this shift in consciousness happens dramatically and radically, once and for all.&#160;&#160;When it does, it usually comes about through total surrender in the midst of
  intense suffering.&#160;&#160;Most people, however, have to work at it.</p>

<p>But to&#160;know&#160;that you are&#160;not&#160;present is a great success: That knowing&#160;is&#160;presence &mdash; even if initially it only lasts for a couple of seconds of clock time before it is lost again. Then, with increasing
  frequency, you&#160;choose&#160;to have the focus of your consciousness in the present moment rather than in the past or future&#8230;</p>

<p>So before you are firmly established in the state of presence, which is to say before you are fully conscious, you shift back and forth for a while between consciousness and unconsciousness, between the state of presence and the state of
  mind identification. You lose the Now, and you return to it, again and again. Eventually, presence becomes your predominant state.</p>

<p>Most humans alternate not between consciousness and unconsciousness but only between different levels of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>&#8230;most people only shift between ordinary unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness. What I call ordinary unconsciousness means being identified with your thought processes and emotions, your reactions, desires, and aversions. It is
  most people&rsquo;s normal state. In that state, you are run by the egoic mind, and you are unaware of Being. It is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an almost continuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom, or
  nervousness &mdash; a kind of background static. You may not realize this because it is so much a part of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; living, just as you are not aware of a continuous low background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner,
  until it stops. When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious attempt to remove the basic unease. When this happens, an
  activity that might be very enjoyable if used in moderation becomes imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, and all that is ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom relief.</p>

<p>The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain of deep unconsciousness &mdash; a state of more acute and more obvious suffering or unhappiness &mdash; when things &ldquo;go wrong,&rdquo; when the ego is threatened or there is a
  major challenge, threat, or loss, real or imagined, in your life situation&#160;or conflict in a relationship. It is an intensified version of ordinary unconsciousness, different from it not in kind but in degree.</p>

<p>The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with life&rsquo;s challenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already unconscious person tends to become more deeply unconscious, and a conscious person more
  intensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sleep.</p>

<p>If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when you are sitting alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to someone, then you certainly won&rsquo;t be able to stay conscious when something &ldquo;goes
  wrong&rdquo; or you are faced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. You will be taken over by a reaction, which ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep unconsciousness. Those challenges
  are your tests. Only the way in which you deal with them will show you and others where you are at as far as your state of consciousness&#160;is concerned, not how long you can sit with your eyes closed or what visions you see.</p>

<h4>DISSOLVING ORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESS</h4>

<p><i>So how can we be free of this affliction?</i></p>

<p>Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, and tension arise within you through unnecessary judgment, resistance to what&#160;is, and denial of the Now. <br />
  However, ordinary unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially because it is so normal.<br />
  Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation. &ldquo;Am I at ease at this moment?&rdquo; is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can ask: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on inside me at this
  moment?&rdquo; Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But don&rsquo;t answer these
  questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect that there is a low
  level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life &mdash; by denying the Now.&#160;</p>

<p>Maybe you&#160;are&#160;being taken advantage of, maybe the activity you are engaged in&#160;is&#160;tedious, maybe someone close to you&#160;is&#160;dishonest, irritating, or unconscious, but all this is irrelevant. Whether your thoughts
  and emotions about this situation are justified or not makes no difference. The fact is that you are resisting what&#160;is. You are making the present moment into an enemy. You are creating unhappiness, conflict between the inner and the
  outer.</p>

<p><i>How can we drop negativity, as you suggest?</i></p>

<p>By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in your hand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage that you are carrying? By recognizing that you don&rsquo;t want to suffer the pain or carry the burden
  anymore and then letting go of it.<br />
  Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or other deep pain, such as the loss of a loved one, usually needs to be transmuted through acceptance combined with the light of your presence &mdash; your sustained attention. Many patterns in
  ordinary unconsciousness, on the other hand, can simply be dropped once you know that you don&rsquo;t want them and don&rsquo;t need them anymore, once you realize that you have a choice, that you are not just a bundle of conditioned
  reflexes.</p>

<p><i>
    My understanding is that we should give ourselves permission to have whatever feelings come up, rather than judge them as bad or say that we shouldn&rsquo;t have them. It&rsquo;s okay to feel resentful; it&rsquo;s okay to be angry,
    irritated, moody, or whatever &mdash; otherwise, we get into repression, inner conflict, or denial. Everything is okay as it is.</i></p>

<p>Of course. Once a mind pattern, an emotion, or a reaction is there, accept it. You were not conscious enough to have a choice in the matter. That&rsquo;s not a judgment, just a fact. If you&#160;had&#160;a choice, or realized that
  you&#160;do&#160;have a choice, would you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or conflict? Would you choose a thought or feeling that cuts you off from your natural state of well-being, the joy of life within? Any such feeling I
  call negative&#8230;</p>

<p>Humans inflicting pain of such magnitude on one another is beyond anything you can imagine. And that&rsquo;s not taking into account the mental, emotional and physical violence, the torture, pain, and cruelty they continue to inflict on
  each other as well as on other sentient beings on a daily basis.<br />
  Do they act in this way because they are in touch with their natural state, the joy of life within? Of course not. Only people&#160;who are in a deeply negative state, who feel very bad indeed, would create such a reality as a reflection of
  how they feel. Now they are engaged in destroying nature and the planet that sustains them. Unbelievable but true. Humans are a dangerously insane and very sick species. That&rsquo;s not a judgment. It&rsquo;s a fact. It is also a fact that
  the sanity&#160;is&#160;there underneath the madness. Healing and redemption are available right now.</p>

<p>When you have been practicing acceptance for a while, as you have, there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where those negative emotions are not created anymore. If you don&rsquo;t, your &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; just
  becomes a mental label that allows your ego to continue to indulge in unhappiness and so strengthen its sense of separation from other people, your surroundings, your here and now. As you know, separation is the basis for the ego&rsquo;s
  sense of identity. True acceptance would transmute those feelings at once. And if you really knew deeply that everything is &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; as you put it, and which of course is true, then would you have those negative feelings in the
  first place? Without judgment, without resistance to what&#160;is, they would not arise. You have an idea in your mind that &ldquo;everything is okay,&rdquo; but deep down you don&rsquo;t really believe it, and so the old mental-emotional
  patterns of resistance are still in place. That&rsquo;s what makes you feel bad.</p>

<p>See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech or thought, about a situation you find yourself in, what other people do or say, your surroundings, your life situation, even the weather. To complain is always nonacceptance of
  what&#160;is. It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power. <em>So <strong>change</strong> the situation by taking action or by speaking
    out if necessary or possible; <strong>leave</strong> the situation or <strong>accept</strong> it. All else is madness.</em></p>

<p>Are you resisting your here and now? Some people would always rather be somewhere else. Their &ldquo;here&rdquo; is never good enough.</p>
<p class="important">Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take
  responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psychic pollution. Keep your inner space clear.</p>

<p>Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it&rsquo;s no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you
  learn nothing. Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the fear, watch it, take your attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing so cuts the link between the fear and your thinking.&#160;Don&rsquo;t let the fear rise
  up into your mind.</p>

<p>If there is truly nothing that you can do to change your here and now, and you can&rsquo;t remove yourself from the situation, then accept your here and now totally by dropping all inner resistance. The false, unhappy self that loves
  feeling miserable, resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer survive. This is called surrender. Surrender is not weakness. There is great strength in it. Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Through surrender, you will be
  free internally of the situation. You may then find that the situation changes without any effort on your part. In any case, you are free.</p>

<p>If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, or even run, without projecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present. As you move, work, run &mdash; do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high energy of that
  moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting yourself in two. Just moving, running, working &mdash; and enjoying it. Or you can drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your mind. It may say:
  &ldquo;You should be working. You are wasting time.&rdquo; Observe the mind. Smile at it.</p>

<p>All that you ever have to deal with, cope with, in real life &mdash; as opposed to imaginary mind projections &mdash; is&#160;this moment. Ask yourself what &ldquo;problem&rdquo; you have right now, not next year, tomorrow, or five minutes
  from now. What is wrong with this moment? You can always cope with the Now, but you can never cope with the future &mdash; nor do you have to. The answer, the strength, the right action or the resource will be there when you need it, not
  before, not after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day I&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo; Is your goal taking up so much of your attention that you reduce the present moment to a means to an end? Is it taking the joy out of your doing? Are you waiting to start living? If you develop
  such a mind pattern, no matter what you achieve or get, the present will never be good enough; the future will always seem better. A perfect recipe for permanent dissatisfaction and nonfulfillment, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Large-scale waiting&rdquo; is waiting for the next vacation, for a better job, for the children to grow up, for a truly meaningful relationship, for success, to make money, to be important, to become enlightened. It is not uncommon
  for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.<br />
  Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; you don&rsquo;t want the present. You don&rsquo;t want what you&rsquo;ve got, and you want what you haven&rsquo;t got. With every kind of waiting, you unconsciously
  create inner conflict between your here and now, where you don&rsquo;t want to be, and the projected future, where you want to be. This greatly reduces the quality of your life by making you lose the present.</p>

<p>You can improve your life situation, but you cannot improve your life. Life is primary. Life is your deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect. Your life situation consists of your circumstances and your experiences.
  There is nothing wrong with setting goals and striving to achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of life, for Being. The only point of access for that is the Now.</p>

<p>For example, many people are waiting for prosperity. It cannot come in the future. When you honor, acknowledge, and fully accept your present reality &mdash; where you are, who you are, what you are doing right now &mdash; when you fully
  accept what you have got, you are grateful for what you have got, grateful for what&#160;is, grateful for Being. Gratitude for the&#160;present moment and the fullness of&#160;life now&#160;is true prosperity. It cannot come in the future.
  Then, in time, that prosperity manifests for you in various ways.</p>

<p>&#8230;The only thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are taking at this moment. That&rsquo;s all there ever is.</p>

<p>Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are&#160;taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all the other
  steps as well as the destination.</p>

<p>Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in the world?</p>

<p>It will matter to you as long as you haven&rsquo;t realized your inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer
  purpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way around, which is actually more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to &ldquo;gain the world and lose your soul,&rdquo; as Jesus puts it. Ultimately,
  of course,&#160;every&#160;outer purpose is doomed to &ldquo;fail&rdquo; sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting
  fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient to your inner purpose.</p>

<h3>
  CHAPTER FIVE<br />
  THE STATE OF PRESENCE</h3>

<p>Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: &ldquo;I wonder what my next thought is going to be.&rdquo; Then become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to
  come out of the mouse hole? Try it now.</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p><i>I had to wait for quite a long time before a thought came in.</i></p>

<p>Exactly. As long as you are in a state of intense presence, you are free of thought. You are still, yet highly alert. The instant your conscious attention sinks below a certain level, thought rushes in. The mental noise returns; the
  stillness is lost. You are back in time.</p>

<p>To stay present in everyday life, it helps to be deeply rooted within yourself; otherwise, the mind, which has incredible momentum, will drag you along like a wild river.</p>

<p><i>What do you mean by &ldquo;rooted within yourself&rdquo;?</i></p>

<p>It means to inhabit your body fully. To always have some of your attention in the inner energy field of your body. To feel the body from within, so to speak. Body awareness keeps you present. It anchors you in the Now.</p>

<p>There is a qualitatively different kind of waiting, one that requires your total alertness. Something could happen at any moment, and if you are not absolutely awake, absolutely still, you will miss it. This is the kind of waiting Jesus
  talks about. In that state, all your attention is in the Now.</p>

<p><i>What you have just described is something that I occasionally experience for brief moments when I am alone and surrounded by nature.</i></p>

<p>Yes. Zen masters use the word&#160;satori&#160;to describe a flash of insight, a moment of no-mind and total presence. Although&#160;satori&#160;is not a lasting transformation, be grateful when it comes, for it gives you a taste of
  enlightenment. You may, indeed, have experienced it many times without knowing what it is and realizing its importance. Presence is needed to become aware of the beauty, the majesty, the sacredness of nature. Have you ever gazed up into the
  infinity of space on a clear night, awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceivable vastness of it? Have you listened, truly listened, to the sound of a mountain stream in the forest? Or to the song of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet
  summer evening? To become aware of such things, the mind needs to be still. </p>

<p class="important">Beyond the beauty of the external forms, there is more here: something that cannot be named, something ineffable, some deep, inner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever there is&#160;beauty, this inner essence shines
  through somehow. It only reveals itself to you when you are present. Could it be that this nameless essence and your presence are one and the same? Would it be there without your presence? Go deeply into it. Find out for yourself.</p>

<p>Mind can neither recognize nor create beauty. Only for a few seconds, while you were completely present, was that beauty or that sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that gap and a lack of vigilance and alertness on your part,
  you were probably unable to see the fundamental difference between the perception, the thoughtless awareness of beauty, and the naming and interpreting of it as thought: The time gap was so small that it seemed to be a single process. The
  truth is, however, that the moment thought came in, all you had was a memory of it.</p>

<p class="important">There is nothing that you need to understand before you can become present.</p>

<p>The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and forms, thought forms and material forms. Look at the millions of life forms on this planet alone. In the sea, on land, in the air &mdash; and then each life form is replicated
  millions of times. To what end? Is someone or something playing a game, a game with form? This is what the ancient seers of&#160;India asked themselves. They saw the world as&#160;lila, a kind of divine game that God is playing. The
  individual life forms are obviously not very important in this game. In the sea, most life forms don&rsquo;t survive for more than a few minutes after being born.&#160;The human form turns to dust pretty quickly too, and when it is gone it
  is as if it had never been. Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you create a separate identity for each form, if you forget that its consciousness is God-essence expressing itself in form. But you don&rsquo;t truly&#160;know&#160;that until
  you realize your own God-essence as pure consciousness.</p>

<p>Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness from mind forms, and it then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness. Consequently, the watcher &mdash; pure consciousness beyond form &mdash; becomes stronger, and the mental
  formations become weaker. When we talk about watching the mind we are personalizing an event that is truly of cosmic significance: Through you, consciousness is awakening out of its dream of identification with form and withdrawing from
  form. This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event that is probably still in the distant future as far as chronological time is concerned. The event is called &mdash; the end of the world.</p>

<p>Already for most humans, the only respite they find from their own minds is to occasionally revert to a level of consciousness below thought. Everyone does that every night during sleep. But this also happens to some extent through sex,
  alcohol, and other drugs that suppress excessive mind activity. If it weren&rsquo;t for alcohol, tranquilizers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, which are all consumed in vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would
  become even more glaringly obvious than it is already. I believe that, if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the population would become a danger to themselves and others. These drugs, of course, simply keep you stuck in dysfunction.
  Their widespread use only delays the breakdown of the old mind structures and the emergence of higher consciousness. While individual users may get some relief from the daily torture inflicted on them by their minds, they are prevented from
  generating enough conscious presence to rise above thought and so find true liberation.</p>

<p>There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness, and you are listening to yourself.</p>

<p>In any case, the words in themselves are not important. They are not the Truth; they only point to it.</p>

<p class="important">Eternity, of course, does not mean endless time, but no time.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;second coming&rdquo; of Christ is a transformation of human consciousness, a shift from time to presence, from thinking to pure consciousness, not the arrival of some man or woman.</p>

<p>f you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is already enough presence in you to recognize presence in another. There were many people who did not recognize Jesus or the Buddha, as there are and always have been many
  people who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX<br />
  THE INNER BODY</h3>

<p><i>I am still not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean by</i> Being.<br />
  &ldquo;Water? What do you mean by that? I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo; This is what a fish would say if it had a human mind.</p>

<p>&#8230;the&#160;illusion&#160;that you are nothing more than your physical body and your mind. This &ldquo;illusion of the self,&rdquo; as the Buddha calls it, is the core error.&#160;</p>

<p>A word is no more than a means to an end. It&rsquo;s an abstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond itself. The word&#160;honey&#160;isn&rsquo;t honey. You can study and talk about honey for as long as you like, but you
  won&rsquo;t really&#160;know&#160;it until you taste it. After you have tasted&#160;it, the word becomes less important to you. You won&rsquo;t be attached to it anymore. Similarly, you can talk or think about&#160;God continuously for the
  rest of your life, but does that mean you know or have even glimpsed the reality to which the word points? </p>

<p>So, if a word doesn&rsquo;t work for you anymore, then drop it and replace it with one that does work.</p>

<h4>CONNECTING WITH THE INNER BODY</h4>

<p>Please try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice. Later on, when &ldquo;being in the body&rdquo; has become natural and easy, this will no longer be necessary. Direct your attention into the body. Feel it
  from within. Is it alive? Is there life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet &mdash; in your abdomen, your chest? Can you feel the subtle energy field that pervades the entire body and gives vibrant life to every organ and every cell? Can
  you feel it simultaneously in all parts of the body as a single field of energy? Keep focusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do not start to think about it. Feel it. The more attention you give it, the clearer and
  stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becoming more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body becoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, pay more
  attention to the feeling than to any image that may arise.</p>

<p>The key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with your inner body &mdash; to feel it at all times. This will rapidly&#160;deepen and transform your life. The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its
  vibrational frequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new
  circumstances that reflect this higher frequency.</p>

<p>Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You are listening to me, or you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attention. You are also peripherally aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on.
  Furthermore, there may be some mind activity around what you are hearing or reading, some mental commentary. Yet there is no need for any of this to absorb&#160;all&#160;your attention. See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the
  same time. Keep some of your attention within. Don&rsquo;t let it all flow out. Feel your whole body from within, as a single field of energy. It is almost as if you were listening or reading with your whole body. Let this be your practice
  in the days and weeks to come.<br />
  Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all means focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same time whenever possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of
  consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.</p>

<p>No matter what happens on the outside, nothing can shake you anymore.</p>

<p>
  In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short life span. It is like a momentary ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. When you are not in your body, however, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, or join
  with other emotions of a similar frequency that have merged and become the pain-body, a parasite that can live inside you for years, feed on your energy, lead to physical illness, and make your life miserable.</p>

<p>Non-forgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it may just as well be toward any situation or condition &mdash; past, present, or future &mdash; that your mind refuses to accept. Yes, there can be nonforgiveness even with
  regard to the future. This is the mind&rsquo;s refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that the future is ultimately beyond its control. ... Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life &mdash; to allow life to live through you. </p>

<p>&#8230;an awakening of consciousness from the dream of form. This does not mean that your own form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You can continue in your present form yet be aware of the formless and deathless deep within
  you.</p>

<p>Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are than thinking. I cannot tell you anything that deep within you don&rsquo;t already know. When you have reached a certain stage of inner connectedness, you recognize the truth when you
  hear it. </p>

<h4>SLOWING DOWN THE AGING PROCESS</h4>

<p>In the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other benefits in the physical realm. One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physical body.</p>

<p>If you are twenty years old now, the energy field of&#160;your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will be just as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual state changes from being out of the body and trapped in
  your mind to being in the body and present in the Now, your physical body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actually becomes less dense. More consciousness means a
  lessening of the illusion of materiality.<br />
  &#8230;when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness and past and future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time anymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time as the
  psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells&rsquo; capacity for self-renewal.</p>

<h4>STRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</h4>

<p>The more consciousness you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system, becomes. It is as if every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. It is also a potent form of self-healing. Most illnesses&#160;creep in
  when you are not present in the body.<br />
  It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; your psychic immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly contagious.
  Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in
  what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn&rsquo;t enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don&rsquo;t need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. </p>

<p>There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. <br />
  Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose&#160;different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as
  you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its
  totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell of your body. Don&rsquo;t be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out
  of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.</p>

<p>If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the inner body, it is usually easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch with
  the body.</p>

<h4>CREATIVE USE OF MIND&#160;</h4>
<p>Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any
  thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness.</p>

<h4>THE ART OF LISTENING</h4>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know how to listen because the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking. They pay more attention to that than to what the other person is saying, and none at all to what really matters: the Being of the
  other person underneath the words and the mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVEN&#160;<br />
  PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED</h3>

<p><i>Is the Unmanifested what in the East is called chi, a kind of universal life energy?</i></p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t. The Unmanifested is the&#160;source&#160;of chi. Chi is the inner energy field of your body. It is the bridge between the outer you and the Source. It lies halfway between the manifested, the world of form, and the
  Unmanifested. Chi can be likened to a river or an energy stream. ... Chi is the link between the Unmanifested and the physical universe.</p>

<p>When your consciousness is directed outward, mind and world arise. When it is directed inward, it realizes its own Source and returns home into the Unmanifested. Then, when your consciousness comes back to the manifested world, you
  reassume the form identity that you temporarily relinquished. You have a name, a past, a life situation, a future. But in one essential&#160;respect, you are not the same person you were before: You will have glimpsed a reality within
  yourself that is not &ldquo;of this world,&rdquo; although it isn&rsquo;t separate from it, just as it isn&rsquo;t separate from you.</p>

<p>Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don&rsquo;t give 100 percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep some within. &#8230; Feel the inner body even when engaged in everyday
  activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you are relating with nature. Feel the stillness deep inside it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your life. You feel it
  as a deep sense of peace somewhere in the background, a stillness that never leaves you, no matter what happens out here. You become a bridge between the Unmanifested and the manifested, between God and the world. This is the state of
  connectedness with the Source that we call enlightenment.</p>

<p>Another portal into the Unmanifested is created through the cessation of thinking. This can start with a very simple thing, such as taking one conscious breath or looking, in a state of intense alertness, at a flower, so that there is no
  mental commentary running at the same time. There are many ways to create a gap in the incessant stream of thought. This is what meditation is all about.</p>

<p><strong>Surrender</strong> &mdash; the <em>letting go of mental-emotional resistance to what&#160;is</em>&#160;&mdash; also becomes a portal into the Unmanifested. The reason for this is simple: inner resistance cuts you off from other
  people, from yourself, from the world around you. It&#160;strengthens the feeling of separateness on which the ego depends for its survival.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you conscious access to the Unmanifested. Get in touch with the energy field of the inner body, be intensely present, disidentify from the mind, surrender to what&#160;is; these
  are all portals you can use &mdash; but you only need to use one.</p>

<p>Love isn&rsquo;t a portal; it&rsquo;s what comes&#160;through&#160;the portal into this world. As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity, there can be no love. <em>Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal
    through which love can enter.</em></p>

<p>The Unmanifested is not separate from the manifested. It pervades this world, but it is so well disguised&#160;that almost everybody misses it completely. If you know where to look, you&rsquo;ll find it everywhere. <em>A portal opens up
    every moment.</em><br />
  Do you hear that dog barking in the distance? Or that car passing by? Listen carefully. Can you feel the presence of the Unmanifested in that? You can&rsquo;t? Look for it in the silence out of which the sounds come and into which they
  return. Pay more attention to the silence than to the sounds. Paying attention to outer silence creates inner silence: the mind becomes still. A portal is opening up.</p>

<p>Even seemingly solid matter, including your physical body, is nearly 100 percent empty space &mdash; so vast are the distances between the atoms compared to their size. What is more, even inside every atom there is mostly empty space. What
  is left is more like a vibrational frequency than particles of solid matter, more like a musical note.</p>

<p>Space has no &ldquo;existence.&rdquo; &ldquo;To exist&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;to stand out.&rdquo; You cannot understand space because it doesn&rsquo;t stand out. Although in itself it has no existence, it enables everything else to
  exist. Silence has no existence either, nor does the Un-manifested.</p>

<p>And the greatest miracle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables the universe to&#160;be&#160;is not just out there in space &mdash; it is also within you. When you are utterly and totally&#160;present, you encounter it as the
  still inner space of no-mind. Within you, it is vast in depth, not in extension. Spacial extension is ultimately a misperception of infinite depth &mdash; an attribute of the one transcendental reality.</p>

<p>You may have heard the Buddhist saying: &ldquo;If there were no illusion, there would be no enlightenment.&rdquo; It is through the world and ultimately through&#160;you&#160;that the Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the
  divine purpose of the universe to unfold.</p>

<p>In any case, whatever is real or of true value in your personality is your true nature shining through. This is never lost. Nothing that is of value, nothing that is&#160;real, is ever lost.</p>

<p><em>The end of illusion &mdash; that&rsquo;s all that death is.</em> It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER EIGHT&#160;<br />
  ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS</h3>

<p><i>I always thought that true enlightenment is not possible except through love in a relationship between a man and a woman. Isn&rsquo;t this what makes us whole again? How can one&rsquo;s life be fulfilled until that happens?</i><br />
  Is that true in your experience? Has this happened to you?</p>

<p><i>Not yet, but how could it be otherwise? I know that it</i> will <i>happen.</i><br />
  In other words, you are waiting for an event&#160;in time&#160;to save you. Is this not the core error that we have been talking about? Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now.</p>

<p>Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of psychological gratification because they believe that those&#160;things will make them happy or free them from a feeling of fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as a heightened
  sense of aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a more secure and more complete sense of self attained through some form of psychological gratification. This is the search for salvation from a state of unsatisfactoriness or
  insufficiency. Invariably, any satisfaction that they obtain is short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or fulfillment is usually projected once again onto an imaginary point away from the here and now. &ldquo;When I
  obtain&#160;this&#160;or am free of&#160;that&#160;&mdash; then I will be okay.&rdquo;<br />
  True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It is to be who you are, to feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that depends on nothing outside itself. It is felt not as a passing experience but
  as an abiding presence.</p>

<p>True salvation is a state of freedom &mdash; from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging.</p>

<p class="important">Your mind is telling you that you cannot get there from here. Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or that before you can be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, that you need time &mdash; that you
  need to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before&#160;you can be free or complete. You see time as the means to salvation, whereas in truth it is the greatest obstacle to salvation.&#160;You think that
  you can&rsquo;t get there from where and who you are at this moment because you are not yet complete or good enough, but the truth is that here and now is the only point from where you&#160;can&#160;get there. You &ldquo;get&rdquo; there by
  realizing that you&#160;are&#160;there already. You find God the moment you realize that you don&rsquo;t need to seek God. So there is no&#160;only&#160;way to salvation: Any condition can be used, but no particular condition is needed.
  However, there is only one point of access: the Now. There can be no salvation away from this moment. You are lonely and without a partner? Enter the Now from there. You are in a relationship? Enter the Now from there.<br />
  There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closer to salvation than it is at this moment. &#8230; <strong>You cannot do this in the future. You do it now or not at all.</strong></p>

<p><i>Why should we become addicted to another person?</i><br />
  The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an intense and universally sought-after experience is that it seems to offer liberation from a deep-seated state of fear, need, lack, and incompleteness that is part of the human
  condition in its unredeemed and unenlightened state.</p>

<p>On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole. On this level, the longing for wholeness &mdash; the return to oneness &mdash; manifests as
  male-female attraction, man&rsquo;s need for a woman, woman&rsquo;s need for a man. It is an almost irresistible urge for union with the opposite energy polarity. The root of this physical urge is a spiritual one: the longing for an end to
  duality, a return to the state of wholeness. Sexual union is the closest you can get to this state on the physical level. This is why it is the most deeply satisfying experience the physical realm can offer. But sexual union is no more than
  a fleeting glimpse of wholeness, an instant of bliss. As long as it is unconsciously sought as a means of salvation, you are seeking the end of duality on the level of form, where it cannot be found. You are given a tantalizing glimpse of
  heaven, but you are not allowed to dwell there, and find yourself again in a separate body.<br />
  On the psychological level, the sense of lack and incompleteness is, if anything, even greater than on the physical level. As long as you are identified with the mind, you have an externally derived sense of self. That is to say, you get
  your&#160;sense of who you are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who you are: your social role, possessions, external appearance, successes and failures, belief systems, and so on. This false, mind-made self, the ego,
  feels vulnerable, insecure, and is always seeking new things to identify with to give it a feeling that it exists. But nothing is ever enough to give it lasting fulfillment. </p>

<p>Your world now has a center: the loved one. The fact that the center is outside you and that, therefore, you still have an externally derived sense of self does not seem to matter at first. What matters is that the underlying feelings of
  incompleteness, of fear, lack, and unfulfillment so characteristic of the egoic state are no longer there &mdash; or are they? </p>

<p class="important">If in your relationships you experience both &ldquo;love&rdquo; and the opposite of love &mdash; attack, emotional violence, and so on &mdash; then it is likely that you are confusing ego attachment and addictive clinging
  with love. You cannot love your partner one moment and attack him or her the next. <strong>True love has no opposite.</strong> If your &ldquo;love&rdquo; has an opposite, then it is not love but a strong ego-need for a more complete and
  deeper sense of&#160;self, a need that the other person temporarily meets. It is the ego&rsquo;s substitute for salvation, and for a short time it almost does feel like salvation.</p>

<p>Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your own pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever the substance you are addicted to &mdash; alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a
  person &mdash; you are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, after the initial euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate relationships. <em>They do not cause pain and unhappiness.
    They <i>bring out</i> the pain and unhappiness that is already in you.</em> Every addiction does that. Every addiction reaches a point where it&#160;does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain more intensely than ever.</p>

<p>This is one reason why most people are always trying to escape from the present moment and are seeking some kind of salvation in the future. The first thing that they might encounter if they focused their attention on the Now is their own
  pain, and this is what they fear. If they only knew how easy it is to access in the Now the power of presence that dissolves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illusion. If they only knew how close they are to their own
  reality, how close to God.</p>

<p>The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way. That immediately takes you beyond ego. All mind games and all addictive clinging
  are then over. There are no victims and no perpetrators anymore, no accuser and accused. This is also the end of all codependency, of being drawn into somebody else&rsquo;s unconscious pattern and thereby enabling it to continue. You will
  then either separate &mdash; in love &mdash; or move ever more deeply into the Now together &mdash; into Being.&#160;<br />
  Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some external form. In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own
  formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that&#160;animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is
  the realization of oneness. This is love.</p>

<p>Millions are now living alone or as single parents, unable to establish an intimate relationship or unwilling to repeat the insane drama of past relationships. Others go from one relationship to another, from one pleasure-and-pain cycle to
  another, in search of the elusive goal of fulfillment through union with the opposite energy polarity. Still others compromise and continue to be together in a dysfunctional relationship in which negativity prevails, for the sake of the
  children or security, through force of habit, fear of being alone, or some other mutually &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo; arrangement, or even through the unconscious addiction to the excitement of emotional drama and pain.<br />
  However, every crisis represents not only danger but also opportunity. If relationships energize and magnify egoic mind patterns and activate the pain-body, as they do at this time, why not accept this fact rather than try to escape from
  it? Why not cooperate with it instead of avoiding relationships or continuing to pursue the phantom of an ideal partner as an answer to your problems or a means of feeling fulfilled? </p>

<p>So whenever your relationship is not working, whenever it brings out the &ldquo;madness&rdquo; in you and in your partner, be glad. What was unconscious is being brought up to the light. It is an opportunity for salvation. Every moment,
  hold the knowing of that moment, particularly of your inner state. If there is anger,&#160;know&#160;that there is anger. If there is jealousy, defensiveness, the urge to argue, the need to be right, an inner child demanding love and
  attention, or emotional pain of any kind &mdash; whatever it is,&#160;know&#160;the reality of that moment and hold the knowing. The relationship then becomes your&#160;sadhana, your spiritual practice. If you observe unconscious behavior
  in your partner, hold it in the loving embrace of your knowing so that you won&rsquo;t react. Unconsciousness and knowing cannot coexist for long &mdash; even if the knowing is only in the other person and not in the one who is acting out
  the unconsciousness. The energy form that lies behind hostility and attack finds the presence of love absolutely intolerable. If you react at all to your partner&rsquo;s unconsciousness, you become unconscious yourself. But if you then
  remember to&#160;know&#160;your reaction, nothing is lost.</p>

<p>If you continue to pursue the goal of salvation through a relationship, you will be disillusioned again and again. But if you accept that the relationship is here to make you&#160;conscious&#160;instead of happy, then the
  relationship&#160;will&#160;offer you salvation, and you will be aligning yourself with the higher consciousness that wants to be born into this world.</p>

<p>How many people does it take to make your life into a spiritual practice? Never mind if your partner will not cooperate. Sanity &mdash; consciousness &mdash; can only come into this world through you. You do not need to wait for the world
  to become sane, or for somebody else to become conscious, before you can be enlightened. You may wait forever. Do not accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment you start to argue, you have identified with a mental position and are
  now defending not only that position but also your sense of self. The ego is in charge. You have become unconscious. At times, it may be appropriate to point out certain aspects of your partner&rsquo;s behavior. If you are very alert, very
  present,&#160;you can do so without ego involvement &mdash; without blaming, accusing, or making the other wrong.<br />
  When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment. Judgment is either to confuse someone&rsquo;s unconscious behavior with who they are or to project your own unconsciousness onto another person and mistake&#160;that&#160;for
  who they are. To relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when you see it. It means &ldquo;being the knowing&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;being the reaction&rdquo; and the judge. You will then
  either be totally free of reaction or you may react and still be the knowing, the space in which the reaction is watched and allowed to be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in the light. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see
  the delusion yet at the same time look through it. Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people to be as they are. No greater catalyst for transformation exists. If you practice this, your
  partner cannot stay with you&#160;and&#160;remain unconscious.</p>

<p>Learn to give expression to what you feel without blaming. Learn to listen to your partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your partner space for expressing himself or herself. Be present. Accusing, defending, attacking &mdash; all
  those patterns that are designed to strengthen or protect the ego or to get its needs met will then become redundant. Giving space to others &mdash;&#160;and to yourself &mdash; is vital. Love cannot flourish without it.</p>

<p>If your partner is still identified with the mind and the pain-body while you are already free, this will represent a major challenge &mdash; not to you but to your partner. It is not easy to live with an enlightened person, or rather it
  is&#160;so&#160;easy that the ego finds it extremely threatening. Remember that the ego needs problems, conflict, and &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; to strengthen the sense of separateness on which its identity depends. The unenlightened
  partner&rsquo;s mind will be deeply frustrated because its fixed positions are not resisted, which means they will become shaky and weak, and there is even the &ldquo;danger&rdquo; that they may collapse altogether, resulting in loss of
  self. The pain-body is demanding feedback and not getting it. The need for argument, drama, and conflict is not being met. But beware: Some people who are unresponsive, withdrawn, insensitive, or cut off from their feelings may think and
  try to convince others that they are enlightened, or at least that there is &ldquo;nothing wrong&rdquo; with them and everything wrong with their partner. Men tend to do that more than women. They may see their female partners as irrational
  or emotional. But if you can feel your emotions, you are not far from the radiant inner body just underneath. If you are&#160;mainly in your head, the distance is much greater, and you need to bring consciousness into the emotional body
  before you can reach the inner body.<br />
  If there isn&rsquo;t an emanation of love and joy, complete presence and openness toward all beings, then it is not enlightenment. Another indicator is how a person behaves in difficult or challenging situations or when things &ldquo;go
  wrong.&rdquo; If your &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon give you a challenge that will bring out your unconsciousness in whatever form &mdash; as fear, anger, defensiveness, judgment, depression, and so
  on. If you are in a relationship, many of your challenges will come through your partner. For example, a woman may be challenged by an unresponsive male partner who lives almost entirely in his head. She will be challenged by his inability
  to&#160;hear&#160;her, to give her attention and space to be, which is due to his lack of presence. The absence of love in the relationship, which is usually more keenly felt by a woman than a man, will trigger the woman&rsquo;s pain-body,
  and through it she will attack her partner &mdash; blame, criticize, make wrong, and so on. This in turn now becomes&#160;his&#160;challenge. To defend himself against her pain-body&rsquo;s attack, which he sees as totally unwarranted, he
  will become even more deeply entrenched in his mental positions as he justifies, defends himself, or counterattacks. Eventually, this may activate his own pain-body. When both partners have thus been taken over, a level of deep
  unconsciousness has been reached, of emotional violence, savage attack and counterattack.</p>

<p>At every stage of the unfolding dysfunctional process, freedom from unconsciousness is possible.</p>

<p>Instead of &ldquo;being&rdquo; the pain-body, the woman could be the knowing that watches the emotional pain in herself, thus accessing the power of the Now and initiating the transmutation of the pain. This would remove the compulsive and
  automatic outward projection of it. She could then express her feelings to her partner. There is no guarantee, of course, that he will listen, but it gives him a good chance to become present and certainly breaks the insane cycle of the
  involuntary acting out of old mind patterns.<br />
  This awareness does not deny the pain and yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transmutes it at the same time. It accepts everything and transforms everything.</p>

<p>If you are consistently or at least predominantly present in your relationship, this will be the greatest challenge for your partner. They will not be able to tolerate your presence for very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready,
  they will walk through the door that you opened for them and join you in that state. If they are not, you will separate like oil and water. The light is too painful for someone who wants to remain in darkness.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the major obstacle for men tends to be the thinking mind, and the major obstacle for women the pain-body, although in certain individual cases the opposite may be true, and in others the two factors may be equal.</p>

<p>Anyone with a strong pain-body and not enough consciousness to disidentify from it will not only continuously or periodically be forced to relive their emotional pain but may also easily become either the perpetrator or the victim of
  violence, depending on whether their pain-body is predominantly active or passive. On the other hand, they may also be potentially closer to enlightenment. This potential isn&rsquo;t necessarily realized, of course, but if you are trapped
  in a nightmare you will probably be more strongly motivated to awaken than someone who is just caught in the ups and downs of an ordinary dream.</p>

<p>Your main task as a woman now is to transmute the pain-body so that it no longer comes between you and your true self, the essence of who you are. Of course, you also have to deal with the other obstacle to enlightenment, which is the
  thinking mind, but the intense presence you generate when dealing with the pain-body will also free you from identification with the mind.<br />
  The first thing to remember is this: As long as you make an identity for yourself out of the pain, you cannot become free of it. As long as part of your sense of self is invested in your emotional pain, you will unconsciously resist or
  sabotage every attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why? Quite simply because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has become an essential part of you. This is an unconscious process, and the only way to overcome it is to make
  it conscious.</p>

<p>The pain-body is an energy field, almost like an entity, that has become temporarily lodged in your inner space. It is life energy that has become trapped, energy that is no longer flowing. Of course, the pain-body is there because of
  certain things that happened in the past. It&#160;is&#160;the living past in you, and if you identify with it, you identify with the past. A victim identity is the belief that the past is more powerful than the present, which&#160;is the
  opposite of the truth. It is the belief that other people and what they did to you are responsible for who you are now, for your emotional pain or your inability to be your true self. The truth is that the only power there is is contained
  within this moment: It is the power of your presence.</p>

<p>When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, before you feel the first signs of what is commonly called premenstrual tension, the awakening of the collective female pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully as
  possible. When the first sign appears, you need to be alert enough to &ldquo;catch&rdquo; it before it takes you over. For example, the first sign may be a sudden, strong irritation or a flash of anger, or it may be a purely physical
  symptom. Whatever it is, catch it before it can take over your thinking or behavior. This simply means putting the spotlight of your attention on it. If it is an emotion, feel the strong energy charge behind it. Know that it is the
  pain-body. At the same time, be the knowing; that is to say, be aware of your conscious presence and feel its power. Any emotion that you take your presence into will quickly subside and become transmuted. If it is a purely physical
  symptom, the attention that you give it will prevent it from turning into an emotion or a thought. Then continue to be alert and wait for the next sign of the pain-body. When it appears, catch it again in the same way as before.</p>

<p>Remember: Do not let the pain-body use your mind and take over your thinking. Watch it. Feel its energy directly, inside your body. As you know, full attention means full acceptance.</p>

<p>In this way, a permanent energy field of a pure and high frequency will arise between you [with your partner]. No illusion, no pain, no conflict, nothing that is not&#160;you, and nothing that is not love can survive in it. This represents
  the fulfillment of the divine, transpersonal purpose of your relationship. It becomes a vortex of consciousness that will draw in many others.</p>

<p><i>When one is fully conscious, would one still have a need for a relationship? Would a man still feel drawn to a woman? Would a woman still feel incomplete without a man?</i><br />
  Enlightened or not, you are either a man or a woman, so on the level of your form identity you are not complete. You are one-half of the whole. This incompleteness is felt as male-female attraction, the pull toward the opposite energy
  polarity, no matter how conscious you are. But in that state of inner connectedness, you feel this pull somewhere on the surface or periphery of your life. Anything that happens to you in that state feels somewhat like that. The whole world
  seems like waves or ripples on the surface of a vast and deep ocean. You are that ocean and, of course, you are also a ripple, but a ripple that has realized its true identity as the&#160;ocean, and compared to that vastness and depth, the
  world of waves and ripples is not all that important.</p>

<p>In Being, male and female are one. Your form may continue to have certain needs, but Being has none. It is already complete and whole. If those needs are met, that is beautiful, but whether or not they are met makes no difference to your
  deep inner state. So it is perfectly possible for an enlightened person, if the need for the male or female polarity is not met, to feel a sense of lack or incompleteness on the outer level of his or her being, yet at the same time be
  totally complete, fulfilled, and at peace within.</p>

<p class="important">But you always get another chance, of course. Acute unhappiness can be a great awakener.</p>

<p>But do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? Why can&rsquo;t you just&#160;be&#160;yourself? When you have a relationship with yourself, you have split yourself into two: &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;myself,&rdquo; subject
  and object. That mind-created duality is the root cause of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and conflict in your life. In the state of enlightenment, you&#160;are&#160;yourself &mdash; &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;yourself&rdquo;
  merge into one. You do not judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are not proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not&#160;hate yourself, and so on. The split caused by self-reflective consciousness is healed,
  its curse removed. There is no &ldquo;self&rdquo; that you need to protect, defend, or feed anymore. When you are enlightened, there is one relationship that you no longer have: the relationship with yourself. Once you have given that up,
  all your other relationships will be love relationships.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER NINE<br />

  BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE</h3>

<p><i>
    Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? If our attitude and our thinking are always positive, we would manifest only positive events and situations, wouldn&rsquo;t we?</i></p>

<p>Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do you have the total picture? There have been many people for whom limitation, failure, loss, illness, or pain in whatever form turned out to be their greatest teacher. It taught
  them to let go of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated goals and desires. It gave them depth, humility, and compassion. It made them more&#160;real.</p>

<p>And when you live in complete acceptance of what&#160;is&#160;&mdash; which is the only sane way to live &mdash; there is no &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in your life anymore. There is only a higher good &mdash; which includes
  the &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgiveness of the present is even more important than forgiveness of the past. If you forgive every moment &mdash; allow it to be as it is &mdash; then there will be no accumulation of resentment that needs to be forgiven at some later
  time.<br />
  Remember that we are not talking about happiness here. For example, when a loved one has just died, or you feel your own death approaching, you cannot be happy. It is impossible. But&#160;you&#160;can&#160;be at peace. There may be sadness
  and tears, but provided that you have relinquished resistance, underneath the sadness you will feel a deep serenity, a stillness, a sacred presence. This is the emanation of Being, this is inner peace, the good that has no opposite.</p>

<p>What if it is a situation that I can do something about? How can I allow it to be and change it at the same time?<br />
  Do what you have to do. In the meantime, accept what&#160;is.</p>

<p>It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering before they will relinquish resistance and accept &mdash; before they will forgive. As soon as they do, one of the greatest miracles happens: the awakening of
  Being-consciousness through what appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering into inner peace. The ultimate effect of all the evil and suffering in the world is that it will force humans into realizing who they are beyond name and form.
  Thus, what we perceive&#160;as evil from our limited perspective is actually part of the higher good that has no opposite. This, however, does not become true for you except through forgiveness.&#160;</p>

<p>You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel unconsciousness &mdash; without&#160;doing&#160;anything &mdash; simply by&#160;being&#160;and holding that frequency of intense presence.</p>

<h4>THE END OF YOUR LIFE DRAMA</h4>

<p>Most of the so-called bad things that happen in people&rsquo;s lives are due to unconsciousness. They are self-created, or rather ego-created. </p>

<p>When egos come together, whether in personal relationships or in organizations or institutions, &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things happen sooner or later: drama of one kind or another, in the form of conflict, problems, power struggles, emotional or
  physical violence, and so on. This includes collective evils such as war, genocide, and exploitation &mdash; all due to massed unconsciousness. Furthermore, many types of illness are caused by the ego&rsquo;s continuous resistance, which
  creates restrictions and blockages in the flow of energy through the body. When you reconnect with Being and are no longer run by your mind, you cease to create those things. You do not create or participate in drama anymore.</p>

<p>But even if you live totally alone, you still create your own drama. When you feel sorry for yourself, that&rsquo;s drama. When you feel guilty or anxious, that&rsquo;s drama. When you let the past or future obscure the present, you are
  creating time, psychological time &mdash; the stuff out of which&#160;drama is made. Whenever you are not honoring the present moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama.</p>

<p>When you live in complete acceptance of what&#160;is, that is the end of all drama in your life. Nobody can even have an argument with you, no matter how hard he or she tries. You cannot have an argument with a fully conscious
  person.<br />
  You can still make your point clearly and firmly, but there will be no reactive force behind it, no defense or attack. So it won&rsquo;t turn into drama.&#160;</p>

<p>However, as long as you are in the physical dimension and linked to the collective human psyche, physical pain &mdash;&#160;although rare &mdash; is still possible. This is not to be confused with suffering, with mental-emotional pain. All
  suffering is ego-created and is due to resistance.</p>

<h4>IMPERMANENCE AND THE CYCLES OF LIFE</h4>

<p>There are cycles of success, when things come to you and thrive, and cycles of failure, when they wither or disintegrate and you have to let them go in order to make room for new things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If you
  cling and resist at that point, it means you are refusing to go with the flow of life, and you will suffer.<br />
  It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, except in the mind&rsquo;s judgment. Growth is usually considered positive, but nothing can grow forever. If growth, of whatever kind, were to go on and on, it would
  eventually become monstrous and destructive. Dissolution is needed for new growth to happen. One cannot exist without the other.<br />
  The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed deeply on some level or experienced&#160;some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension. Or perhaps your very success became empty and
  meaningless and so turned out to be failure.</p>

<p>You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating new forms and circumstances, but you won&rsquo;t be identified with them. You do not need them to give you a sense of self. They are not your life &mdash; only your life situation.
</p>

<p>Many illnesses are created through fighting against the cycles of low energy, which are vital for regeneration. The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as
  achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind. This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and allow them to be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may take over as a
  self-protective measure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that the necessary regeneration can take place.</p>

<p>As long as a condition is judged as &ldquo;good&rdquo; by your mind, whether it be a relationship, a possession, a social role, a place, or your physical body, the mind attaches itself to it and identifies with it. It makes you happy,
  makes you feel good about yourself, and it may become part of who you are or think you are. But nothing lasts in this dimension where moth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it may undergo a polarity shift: The same
  condition that was good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned into bad. The same condition that made you happy then makes you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the empty consumerism of tomorrow. The happy wedding
  and honeymoon become the unhappy divorce or the unhappy coexistence. Or a condition disappears, so its absence makes you unhappy. When a condition or situation that the mind has attached itself to and identified with changes or disappears,
  the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappearing condition and resist the change. It is almost as if a limb were being torn off your body.<br />
  We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money or whose reputations have been ruined committing suicide. Those are the extreme cases. Others, whenever a major loss of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappy or make
  themselves ill. They cannot distinguish between&#160;their life and their life situation. I recently read about a famous actress who died in her eighties. As her beauty started to fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew desperately
  unhappy and became a recluse. She, too, had identified with a condition: her external appearance. First, the condition gave her a happy sense of self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to connect with the formless and timeless life
  within, she could have watched and allowed the fading of her external form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover, her external form would have become increasingly transparent to the light shining through from her ageless true nature,
  so her beauty would not really have faded but simply become transformed into spiritual beauty. </p>

<p>This is not &#8230; saying that you should no longer appreciate pleasant or beautiful things or conditions. But to seek something through them that they cannot give &mdash; an identity, a sense of permanency and fulfillment &mdash; is a
  recipe for frustration and suffering. The whole advertising industry and&#160;consumer society would collapse if people became enlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through&#160;things. The more you seek happiness in this
  way, the more it will elude you. Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially, but you may need to experience many disillusionments before you realize that truth. Things and conditions can give you pleasure,
  but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you pleasure, but they cannot give you&#160;joy. ... It is an essential part of the inner state of peace, the state that has been called the peace of God. It is your natural
  state, not something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain.<br />
  Many people never realize that there can be no &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; in anything they do, possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary and depressed: If nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left to
  strive for, what is the point in anything? &#8230; When you reach this point, you are one step away from despair &mdash; and one step away from enlightenment.</p>

<p>It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now
  come to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them &mdash; while they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no
  fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.</p>

<p>Even if everything were to collapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace. You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.</p>

<h4>USING AND RELINQUISHING NEGATIVITY</h4>

<p>The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate reality and get what it wants. It believes that through it, it can attract a desirable condition or dissolve an undesirable one.&#160;A Course in Miracles&#160;rightly points out
  that, whenever you are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness &ldquo;buys&rdquo; you what you want. &#8230; The fact is, of course, that negativity does not work. Instead of attracting a desirable condition, it stops
  it from arising. Instead of dissolving an undesirable one, it keeps it in place. Its only &ldquo;useful&rdquo; function is that it strengthens the ego, and that is why the ego loves it.<br />
  Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go, and on a deeply unconscious level, you do not want positive change. It would threaten your identity as a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will
  then ignore, deny, or sabotage the positive in your life.</p>

<p>I have lived with several Zen masters &mdash; all of them cats.</p>

<p>But any changes that you make, whether they have to do with your work, your relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmetic unless they arise out of a change in your level of consciousness. And as far as that is
  concerned, it can only mean one thing: becoming more present. ... But as long as negativity&#160;is&#160;there, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that reminds you to be more present.</p>

<p>Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has arisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that is telling you: &ldquo;Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called&#160;Island... The first thing that the man notices are the&#160;colorful parrots perched in the trees, and they seem to be constantly croaking the words &ldquo;Attention. Here and Now. Attention.
  Here and Now.&rdquo; We later learn that the islanders taught them these words in order to be reminded continuously to stay present.</p>

<p>Even the slightest irritation is significant and needs to be acknowledged and looked at; otherwise, there will be a cumulative buildup of unobserved reactions. As I said before, you may be able to just drop it once you realize that you
  don&rsquo;t want to have this energy field inside you and that it serves no purpose. But then make sure that you drop it completely. If you cannot drop it, just accept that it is there and take your attention into the feeling, as I pointed
  out earlier.<br />
  As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can make it disappear by imagining yourself becoming transparent to the external cause of the reaction. I recommend that you practice it with little, even trivial, things first.
  Let&rsquo;s say that you are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the penetrating sound of a car alarm from across the street. Irritation arises. What is the purpose of the irritation? None whatsoever. Why did you create it? You
  didn&rsquo;t. The mind did. It was totally automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the mind create it? Because it holds the unconscious belief that its resistance, which you experience as negativity or unhappiness in some form, will somehow
  dissolve the undesirable condition. This, of course, is a delusion. The resistance that it creates, the irritation or anger in this case, is far&#160;more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting to dissolve.<br />
  All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. Feel yourself becoming transparent, as it were, without the solidity of a material body. Now allow the noise, or whatever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. It is no
  longer hitting a solid &ldquo;wall&rdquo; inside you. As I said, practice with little things first. The car alarm, the dog barking, the children screaming, the traffic jam. Instead of having a wall of resistance inside you that gets
  constantly and painfully hit by things that &ldquo;should not be happening,&rdquo; let everything pass through you.</p>
<p>Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead of going into unconscious reaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you let it pass right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as if there
  is nobody there to get hurt anymore.&#160;That&#160;is forgiveness. In this way, you become invulnerable. You can still tell that person that his or her behavior is unacceptable, if that is what you choose to do. But that person no longer
  has the power to control your inner state. You are then in your power &mdash; not in someone else&rsquo;s, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it is a car alarm, a rude person, a flood, an earthquake, or the loss of all your possessions,
  the resistance mechanism is the same.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t look for peace. Don&rsquo;t look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you&#160;completely
  accept your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender.</p>

<p>Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great Zen master, he spent many years in the pursuit of enlightenment, but it eluded him. Then one day, as he was walking in the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a butcher
  and his customer. &ldquo;Give me the best piece of meat you have,&rdquo; said the customer. And the butcher replied, &ldquo;Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is no piece of meat here that is not the best.&rdquo; Upon hearing
  this, Banzan became enlightened.</p>

<p><i>
    When you become this detached, does it not mean that you also become remote from other human beings?</i></p>

<p>On the contrary. As long as you are unaware of Being, the reality of other humans will elude you, because you have not found your own. Your mind will like or dislike their form, which is not just their body but includes their mind as well.
  True relationship becomes possible only when there is an awareness of Being. Coming from Being, you will perceive another person&rsquo;s body and mind as just a screen, as it were,&#160;behind which you can feel their true reality, as you
  feel yours.</p>

<p>At the level of Being, all suffering is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due to identification with form. Miracles of healing sometimes occur through this realization, by awakening Being-consciousness in others &mdash; if they are
  ready.</p>

<h4>TOWARD A DIFFERENT ORDER OF REALITY</h4>

<p>Every moment,&#160;your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit. One of the greatest insights that has come out of modern physics is that of the unity between the observer and the observed: the person conducting the experiment
  &mdash; the observing consciousness &mdash; cannot be separated from the observed phenomena, and a different way of looking causes the observed phenomena to behave differently. If you believe, on a deep level, in separation and the struggle
  for survival, then you see that belief reflected all around you and your perceptions are governed by fear. You inhabit a world of death and of bodies fighting, killing, and devouring each other.<br />
  Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and see through the egoic mind may seem a very imperfect place, even a vale of tears. <em>But whatever you perceive is only a kind of symbol, like an image in a dream.</em> It is how
  your consciousness interprets and interacts with the molecular energy dance of the universe.&#160;<br />
  &#8230; An infinite number of completely different interpretations, completely different worlds, is possible and, in fact, exists &mdash; all depending on the perceiving consciousness. Every being is a focal point of consciousness, and
  every such focal point creates its own world, although all those worlds are interconnected. There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin world, and so on. There are countless beings whose consciousness frequency is so different from
  yours that you are probably unaware of their existence, as they are of yours. Highly conscious beings who are aware of their connectedness with the Source and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as a heavenly
  realm &mdash; and yet all worlds are ultimately one.<br />
  Even within the collective human world there are vast differences, many different &ldquo;sub-worlds,&rdquo; depending on the perceivers or creators of their respective worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, when collective human
  consciousness becomes transformed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that transformation. Hence the statement in the Bible that in the coming age &ldquo;The lion shall lie down with the lamb.&rdquo; This points to the possibility
  of a completely different order of reality.</p>

<p>You can still enjoy the passing pleasures of this world, but there is no fear of loss anymore, so you don&rsquo;t need to cling to them. Although you can enjoy sensory pleasures, the craving for sensory experience is gone, as is the
  constant search for fulfillment through psychological gratification, through feeding the ego. You are in touch with something infinitely greater than any pleasure, greater than any manifested thing.<br />
  In a way, you then don&rsquo;t need the world anymore. You don&rsquo;t even need it to be different from the way it is.<br />
  It is only at this point that you begin to make a real contribution toward bringing about a better world, toward creating a different order of reality. It is only at this point that you are able to feel true compassion and to help others at
  the level of cause. Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.</p>

<p>Everybody you come in contact with will be touched by your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate, whether they are conscious of it or not. When you are fully present and people around you manifest unconscious behavior, you
  won&rsquo;t feel the need to react to it, so you don&rsquo;t give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace disappears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and
  reaction. Animals, trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach through being, through demonstrating the peace of God. You become the &ldquo;light of the world,&rdquo; an emanation of pure consciousness, and so you
  eliminate suffering on the level of cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.</p>

<p>But who you&#160;are&#160;is always a more vital teaching and a more powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essential even than what you do.</p>

<p>When a hungry person asks you for bread and you have some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, even though your interaction may only be very&#160;brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of which the bread is
  only a symbol. A deep healing takes place within it.&#160;</p>

<p>If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a very noble thing to do, but remember not to focus exclusively on the outer; otherwise, you will encounter frustration and despair. Without a profound change in human
  consciousness, the world&rsquo;s suffering is a bottomless pit. So don&rsquo;t let your compassion become one-sided. Empathy with someone else&rsquo;s pain or lack and a desire to help need to be balanced with a deeper realization of the
  eternal nature of all life and the ultimate illusion of all pain. Then let your peace flow into whatever you do and you will be working on the levels of effect and cause simultaneously.<br />
  Remember: Just as you cannot fight the darkness, so you cannot fight unconsciousness. If you try to do so, the polar opposites will become strengthened and more deeply entrenched. You will become identified with one of the polarities, you
  will create an&#160;&ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; and so be drawn into unconsciousness yourself. Raise awareness by disseminating information, or at the most, practice passive resistance. But make sure that you carry no resistance within, no hatred,
  no negativity. &ldquo;Love your enemies,&rdquo; said Jesus, which, of course, means &ldquo;have no enemies.&rdquo;<br />
  Once you get involved in working on the level of effect, it is all too easy to lose yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very present. The causal level needs to remain your primary focus, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and
  peace your most precious gift to the world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TEN&#160;<br />
  THE MEANING OF SURRENDER</h3>

<p>The only place where&#160;you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation.<br />
  &#8230;when things &ldquo;go wrong,&rdquo; which means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations of your mind and what&#160;is. That is the pain gap.&#160;If you have lived long enough, you will know that things
  &ldquo;go wrong&rdquo; quite often. It is precisely at those times that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain and sorrow from your life.&#160;<br />
  Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean that on the outer level you cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment
  called the Now.<br />
  For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you wouldn&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;Okay, I resign myself to being stuck in the mud.&rdquo; Resignation is not surrender. You don&rsquo;t need to accept an undesirable or unpleasant life
  situation. Nor do you need to deceive yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with being stuck in the mud. No. You recognize fully that you want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down to the present moment without
  mentally labeling it in any way. This means that there is no judgment of the Now. Therefore, there is no resistance, no emotional negativity. You accept the &ldquo;isness&rdquo; of this moment. Then you take action and do all that you can
  to get out of the mud. Such action I&#160;call positive action. It is far more effective than negative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustration. Until you achieve the desired result, you continue to practice surrender by
  refraining from labeling the Now.<br />
  Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am making. You are walking along a path at night, surrounded by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashlight that cuts through the fog and creates a narrow, clear space in front
  of you. The fog is your life situation, which includes past and future; the flashlight is your conscious presence; the clear space is the Now.</p>

<p>If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intolerable, it is only by surrendering first that you can break the unconscious resistance pattern that perpetuates that situation.</p>

<p>In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to be done, and you take action, doing one thing at a time and focusing on one thing at a time. Learn from nature: See how everything gets accomplished and how the miracle of life
  unfolds without dissatisfaction or unhappiness.<br />
  If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant,&#160;separate out this instant&#160;and surrender to what&#160;is. That&rsquo;s the flashlight cutting through the fog. <br />
  Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Is there anything I can do to change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?&rdquo; If so, you take appropriate action. Focus not on the one hundred things that
  you will or may have to do at some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do now. But make sure you don&rsquo;t
  start to run &ldquo;mental movies,&rdquo;&#160;project yourself into the future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately. Until it does &mdash; do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and
  you cannot remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you enter this timeless dimension of the present, <em>change
    often comes about in strange ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part.</em> Life becomes helpful and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from taking action, they will dissolve in
  the light of your conscious presence.</p>

<p>Through surrender, spiritual energy comes into this world. It creates no suffering for yourself, for other humans, or any other life form on the planet. Unlike mind energy, it does not pollute the earth, and it is not subject to the law of
  polarities, which dictates that nothing can exist without its opposite, that there can be no good without bad.</p>

<p>The external conditions that were being resisted also tend to shift or dissolve quickly through surrender. It is a powerful transformer of situations and people. If conditions do not shift immediately, your acceptance of the Now enables
  you to rise above them. Either way, you are free.</p>

<h4>SURRENDER IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS</h4>

<p><i>What about people who want to use me, manipulate or control me? Am I to surrender to them?</i></p>

<p>It is true that only an unconscious person will try to use or manipulate others, but it is equally true that only an unconscious person&#160;can&#160;be used and manipulated. If you resist or fight unconscious behavior in others, you
  become unconscious yourself. But surrender doesn&rsquo;t mean that you allow yourself to be used by unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possible to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; firmly and clearly to a person or to walk away from a
  situation and be in a state of complete inner nonresistance at the same time. <em>When you say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a person or a situation, let it come not from reaction but from insight, from a clear realization of what is right or not
    right for you at that moment. Let it be a nonreactive &ldquo;no,&rdquo; a high-quality &ldquo;no,&rdquo; a &ldquo;no&rdquo; that is free of all negativity and so creates no further suffering.</em></p>

<p>Your relationships will be changed profoundly by surrender. If you can never accept what&#160;is, by implication you will not be able to accept anybody the way they are. You will judge, criticize, label, reject, or attempt to change
  people.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own position
  is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other person&rsquo;s position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feel the mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other
  person wrong. That&rsquo;s the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious by acknowledging it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you
  may decide to drop your own reaction &mdash; just to see what happens. You&#160;surrender. I don&rsquo;t mean dropping the reaction just verbally by saying, &ldquo;Okay, you are right,&rdquo; with a look on your face that says, &ldquo;I am
  above all this childish unconsciousness.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s just displacing the resistance to another level, with the egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking of letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field
  inside you that was fighting for power.</p>

<p>If you suddenly feel very light, clear, and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that you have truly surrendered. Then observe what happens to the other person&rsquo;s mental position as you no longer energize it through
  resistance. When identification with mental positions is out of the way, true communication begins.</p>

<p>Nonresistance doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean doing nothing. All it means is that any &ldquo;doing&rdquo; becomes nonreactive. Remember the deep wisdom underlying the practice of Eastern martial arts: Don&rsquo;t resist the opponent&rsquo;s
  force. Yield [&#1086;&#1090;&#1089;&#1090;&#1098;&#1087;&#1080;] to overcome.<br />
  Having said that, &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo; when you are in a state of intense presence is a very powerful transformer and healer of situations and people. In Taoism, there is a term called&#160;wu wei, which is usually translated as
  &ldquo;actionless activity&rdquo; or &ldquo;sitting quietly doing nothing.&rdquo; In ancient China, this was regarded as one of the highest achievements or virtues. It is radically different from inactivity in the ordinary state
  of&#160;consciousness, or rather unconsciousness, which stems from fear, inertia, or indecision. The real &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo; implies inner nonresistance and intense alertness.</p>

<p class="important">Until there is surrender, unconscious role-playing constitutes a large part of human interaction. In surrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. <strong>You become very simple, very real.</strong>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s dangerous,&rdquo; says the ego. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get hurt. You&rsquo;ll become vulnerable.&rdquo; What the ego doesn&rsquo;t know, of course, is that only through the letting go of resistance, through becoming
  &ldquo;vulnerable,&rdquo; can you discover your true and essential invulnerability.</p>

<p>Surrender does not transform what&#160;is, at least not directly. Surrender transforms&#160;you. When&#160;you&#160;are transformed, your whole world is transformed, because the world is only a reflection.<br />
  If you looked in the mirror and did not like what you saw, you would have to be mad to attack the image in the mirror. That&#160;is precisely what you do when you are in a state of nonacceptance. And, of course, if you attack the image, it
  attacks you back. If you accept the image, no matter what it is, if you become friendly toward it, it cannot&#160;not&#160;become friendly toward you. This is how you change the world.</p>

<h4>WHEN DISASTER STRIKES</h4>

<p>Anything &ldquo;bad&rdquo; that happens in your life &mdash; use it for enlightenment.<br />
  &#160;<br />
  As far as the still unconscious majority of the population is concerned, only a critical limit-situation has the potential to crack the hard shell of the ego and force them into surrender and so into the awakened state. A limit-situation
  arises when through some disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or&#160;suffering your whole world is shattered and doesn&rsquo;t make sense anymore. It is an encounter with death, be it physical or psychological. The egoic mind, the
  creator of this world, collapses. Out of the ashes of the old world, a new world can then come into being.</p>

<p>Limit-situations have produced many miracles. There have been murderers on death row waiting for execution who, in the last few hours of their lives, experienced the egoless state and the deep joy and peace that come with it. The inner
  resistance to the situation they found themselves in became so intense as to produce unbearable suffering, and there was nowhere to run and nothing to do to escape it, not even a mind-projected future. So they were forced into complete
  acceptance of the unacceptable. They were forced into surrender. In this way, they were able to enter the state of grace with which comes redemption: complete release from the past. </p>

<p>So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something goes seriously &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; &mdash; illness, disability, loss of home or fortune or of a socially defined identity, breakup of a close&#160;relationship, death or suffering of a
  loved one, or your own impending death &mdash; know that there is another side to it, that you are just one step away from something incredible: a complete alchemical transmutation of the base metal of pain and suffering into gold. That one
  step is called surrender.<br />
  I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a situation. You will not. But fear and pain will become transmuted into an inner peace and serenity that come from a very deep place &mdash; from the Unmanifested itself. It is
  &ldquo;the peace of God, which passes all understanding.&rdquo; Compared to that, happiness is quite a shallow thing. With this radiant peace comes the realization &mdash; not on the level of mind but within the depth of your Being &mdash;
  that you are indestructible, immortal. </p>

<p>Knowing that what&#160;is&#160;cannot be undone &mdash;because it already&#160;is&#160;&mdash; you say yes to what&#160;is&#160;or accept what isn&rsquo;t. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situation requires. If you abide in
  this state of acceptance, you create no more negativity, no more suffering, no more unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a state of grace and lightness, free of struggle.</p>

<p>Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot accept what is outside, then accept what is&#160;inside. If you cannot accept the external condition, accept the internal condition. This means: Do not resist the pain. Allow it to
  be there. Surrender to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form the suffering takes. Witness it without labeling it mentally. Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender transmutes deep suffering into deep peace.&#160;
</p>

<p>When there is no way out, there is still always a way&#160;through. So don&rsquo;t turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully.&#160;Feel&#160;it &mdash; don&rsquo;t&#160;think&#160;about it! Express it if necessary, but don&rsquo;t
  create a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to have caused it. Don&rsquo;t let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it.
  Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your
  complete attention to what you feel, and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, observe it but
  don&rsquo;t act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert, stay present &mdash; present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As
  you do so,&#160;you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame of your consciousness.</p>

<p>Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgotten it is an inseparable part of the sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to an identity other than the sun. Would the death of this delusion not
  be incredibly liberating?</p>

<p>Do you want an easy death? Would you rather die without pain, without agony? Then die to the past every moment, and let the light of your presence shine away the heavy, time-bound self you thought of as &ldquo;you.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>THE WAY OF THE CROSS</h4>

<p class="important">The amazing and incomprehensible fact is not that you <i>can</i> become conscious of God but that you are <i>not</i> conscious of God.</p>

<p>Enlightenment through suffering &mdash; the way of the cross &mdash; means to be forced into the kingdom of heaven kicking and screaming. You finally surrender because you can&rsquo;t stand the pain anymore, but the pain could go on for a
  long time until&#160;this happens. Enlightenment consciously chosen means to relinquish your attachment to past and future and to make the Now the main focus of your life. It means choosing to dwell in the state of presence rather than in
  time. It means saying yes to what&#160;is. You then don&rsquo;t need pain anymore. How much more time do you think you will need before you are able to say, &ldquo;I will create no more pain, no more suffering&rdquo;? How much more pain do
  you need before you can make that choice?<br />
  If you think that you need more time, you will get more time &mdash; and more pain. Time and pain are inseparable.</p>

<h4>THE POWER TO CHOOSE</h4>

<p>What about all those people who, it seems, actually want to suffer? I have a friend whose partner is physically abusive toward her, and her previous relationship was of a similar kind. Why does she choose such men, and why is she refusing
  to get out of that situation now? Why do so many people actually choose pain?</p>

<p>Choice implies consciousness &mdash; a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no choice. Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and its conditioned patterns, the moment you become present. Until you reach that
  point, you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. This means that you are compelled to think, feel, and act in certain ways according to the conditioning of your mind. That is why Jesus said: &ldquo;Forgive&#160;them, for they know not what
  they do.&rdquo; This is not related to intelligence in the conventional sense of the word. I have met many highly intelligent and educated people who were also completely unconscious, which is to say completely identified with their mind.
  In fact, if mental development and increased knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corresponding growth in consciousness, the potential for unhappiness and disaster is very great.<br />
  Your friend is stuck in a relationship with an abusive partner, and not for the first time. Why? No choice. The mind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re-create what it knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at
  least it is familiar. The mind always adheres to the known. The unknown is dangerous because it has no control over it. That&rsquo;s why the mind dislikes and ignores the present moment. Present-moment awareness creates a gap not only in
  the stream of mind but also in the past-future continuum. Nothing truly new and creative can come into this world except through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibility.</p>

<p>&#8230;If you tell her that she has chosen her condition or&#160;situation, you are reinforcing her state of mind identification. But is her mind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her true identity derived from the past? Show your
  friend how to be the observing presence behind her thoughts and her emotions. Tell her about the pain-body and how to free herself from it. Teach her the art of inner-body awareness. Demonstrate to her the meaning of presence. As soon as
  she is able to access the power of the Now, and thereby break through her conditioned past, she&#160;will&#160;have a choice.</p>

<p>
  &#8230;you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that was ever done to you could touch even in the slightest the radiant essence of who you are. The whole concept of forgiveness then becomes unnecessary.<br />
