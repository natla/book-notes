          <h4>The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.</h4>
          <p class="author">MARCUS AURELIUS</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>PART 1<br />PERCEPTION</h3>

        <h4>RECOGNIZE YOUR POWER</h4>
        <p>...through our perception of events, we are complicit in the creation&mdash;as well as the destruction&mdash;of every one of our obstacles.<br />
          There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means.</p>
        <h4>STEADY YOUR NERVES</h4>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t think for a second that grace and poise and serenity are the soft attributes of some aristocrat. Ultimately, nerve is a matter of defiance and control.</p>
        <p>Defiance and acceptance come together well in the following principle: There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are
          high, but the path is there for those ready to take it.</p>
        <h4>CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS</h4>
        <p>Another way of putting it: <em>Does getting upset provide you with more options?</em><br />
          Sometimes it does. But in <i>this</i> instance?<br />
          <i>No, I suppose not.</i><br />
          Well, then.
        </p>
        <p><i>Does what happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness?</i></p>
        <h4>PRACTICE OBJECTIVITY</h4>
        <p>A deer&rsquo;s brain tells it to run because things are bad. It runs. Sometimes, right into traffic.<br />
          We can question that impulse. We can disagree with it. We can override the switch, examine the threat before we act.</p>
        <h4>ALTER YOUR PERSPECTIVE</h4>
        <blockquote class="important">
          <h4>Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.</h4>
          <p class="author">VIKTOR FRANKL</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>we tend to look at things in isolation. We kick ourselves for blowing a deal or having to miss a meeting. Individually, that does suck&mdash;we just missed 100 percent of that opportunity.<br />
          What we&rsquo;re forgetting in that instance, as billionaire serial entrepreneur Richard Branson likes to say, is that <q>business opportunities are like buses; there&rsquo;s always another coming around.</q> One meeting is nothing in a
          lifetime of meetings, one deal is just one deal. In fact, we may have actually dodged a bullet. The next opportunity might be better.</p>
        <h4>IS IT UP TO YOU?</h4>
        <blockquote class="important">
          <h4>In life our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control.</h4>
          <p class="author">EPICTETUS</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT</h4>
        <p>The implications of our obstacle are theoretical&mdash;they exist in the past and the future. We live in the moment. And the more we embrace that, the easier the obstacle will be to face and move.</p>
        <h4>THINK DIFFERENTLY</h4>
        <p>An entrepreneur is someone with faith in their ability to make something where there was nothing before. To them, the idea that no one has ever done this or that is a good thing. When given an unfair task, some rightly see it as a chance
          to test what they&rsquo;re made of&mdash;to give it all they&rsquo;ve got, knowing full well how difficult it will be to win. They see it as an opportunity because it is often in that desperate nothing-to-lose state that we are our most
          creative.</p>
        <h4>FINDING THE OPPORTUNITY</h4>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s take a circumstance we&rsquo;ve all been in: having a bad boss. All we see is the hell. All we see is that thing bearing down on us. We flinch.<br />
          But what if you regarded it as an opportunity instead of a disaster?<br />
          If you mean it when you say you&rsquo;re at the end of your rope and would rather quit, you actually have a unique chance to grow and improve yourself. A unique opportunity to experiment with different solutions, to try different tactics,
          or to take on new projects to add to your skill set. You can study this bad boss and learn from him&mdash;while you fill out your resume and hit up contacts for a better job elsewhere. You can prepare yourself for that job by trying new
          styles of communication or standing up for yourself, all with a perfect safety net for yourself: quitting and getting out of there.</p>
        <p>Or that computer glitch that erased all your work? You will now be twice as good at it since you will do it again.</p>
        <p>Blessings and burdens are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        <h3>PART 2<br />ACTION</h3>

        <h4>GET MOVING</h4>
        <p><a class="detail-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart" target="_blank">[Amelia Earhart]</a> couldn&rsquo;t make her living as a pilot, so she took a job as a social worker. Then one day the phone rang. The man on the
          line had a pretty offensive proposition, along the lines of: <i>We have someone willing to fund the first female transatlantic flight. Our first choice has already backed out. You won&rsquo;t get to actually fly the plane, and we&rsquo;re
            going to send two men along as chaperones and guess what, we&rsquo;ll pay them a lot of money and you won&rsquo;t get anything. Oh, and you very well might die while doing it.</i><br />
          You know what she said to that offer? She said <i>yes.</i><br />
          Because that&rsquo;s what people who defy the odds do. That&rsquo;s how people who become great at things&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s flying or blowing through gender stereotypes&mdash;do. They start. Anywhere. Anyhow. They don&rsquo;t care if
          the conditions are perfect or if they&rsquo;re being slighted. Because they know that once they get started, if they can just get some momentum, they can make it work.</p>

        <h4>PRACTICE PERSISTENCE</h4>
        <p>Doing new things invariably means obstacles. A new path is, by definition, uncleared. Only with persistence and time can we cut away debris and remove impediments. Only in struggling with the impediments that made others quit can we find
          ourselves on untrodden territory&mdash;only by persisting and resisting can we learn what others were too impatient to be taught.</p>

        <h4>ITERATE</h4>
        <p>When failure does come, ask: <i>What went wrong here? What can be improved? What am I missing?</i> This helps birth alternative ways of doing what needs to be done, ways that are often much better than what we started with. Failure puts
          you in corners you have to think your way out of. It is a source of breakthroughs.</p>

        <h4>FOLLOW THE PROCESS</h4>
        <blockquote class="important">
          <h4>That&rsquo;s the process: Let&rsquo;s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.</h4>
          <p class="author">Coach Nick Saban</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it&rsquo;s our dream because it&rsquo;s so much work&mdash;we can&rsquo;t imagine how we get from here to there.</p>
        <p>How often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is too ambitious or outside our grasp? How often do we assume that change is impossible because it&rsquo;s too big? Involves too many different groups? Or worse,
          how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They&rsquo;re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want
          and need to go.<br />
          All these issues are solvable. Each would collapse beneath the process. We&rsquo;ve just wrongly assumed that it has to happen all at once, and we give up at the thought of it. We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet
          forgetting all about B through Y.</p>

        <h4>DO YOUR JOB, DO IT RIGHT</h4>
        <p>You should never have to ask yourself, <i>But what am I supposed to do now?</i> Because you know the answer: your job.<br /> Whether anyone notices, whether we&rsquo;re paid for it, whether the project turns out successfully&mdash;it
          doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

        <h4>WHAT&rsquo;S RIGHT IS WHAT WORKS</h4>
        <p>The Stoics had their own reminder: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go expecting Plato&rsquo;s Republic.&rdquo;<br />
          Because you&rsquo;re never going to find that kind of perfection. Instead, do the best with what you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
        <p>Start thinking like a radical pragmatist: still ambitious, aggressive, and rooted in ideals, but also imminently practical and guided by the possible. Not on everything you would like to have, not on changing the world right at this
          moment, but ambitious enough to get everything you <i>need.</i> Don&rsquo;t think small, but make the distinction between the critical and the extra.</p>

        <h4>IN PRAISE OF THE FLANK ATTACK</h4>

        <p>Of course, when pushed, the natural instinct is always to push back. But martial arts teach us that we have to ignore this impulse. We can&rsquo;t push back, we have to <i>pull</i> until opponents lose their balance. Then we make our move.
        </p>

        <p>The great philosopher S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard rarely sought to convince people directly from a position of authority. Instead of lecturing, he practiced a method he called &ldquo;indirect communication.&rdquo; Kierkegaard would write
          under pseudonyms, where each fake personality would embody a different platform or perspective&mdash;writing multiple times on the same subject from multiple angles to convey his point emotionally and dramatically. He would rarely tell the
          reader &ldquo;do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;think that.&rdquo; Instead he would show new ways of looking at or understanding the world.</p>

        <h4>USE OBSTACLES AGAINST THEMSELVES</h4>

        <p>Sometimes in your life you need to have patience&mdash;wait for temporary obstacles to fizzle out. Let two jousting egos sort themselves out instead of jumping immediately into the fray. Sometimes a problem needs less of you&mdash;fewer
          people period&mdash;and not more.<br />
          When we want things too badly we can be our own worst enemy. In our eagerness, we strip the very screw we want to turn and make it impossible to ever get what we want. We spin our tires in the snow or mud and dig a deeper rut&mdash;one that
          we&rsquo;ll never get out of.<br />
          We get so consumed with moving forward that we forget that there are other ways to get where we are heading. It doesn&rsquo;t naturally occur to us that standing still&mdash;or in some cases, even going backward&mdash;might be the best way
          to advance. Don&rsquo;t just do something, stand there!<br />
          We push and push&mdash;to get a raise, a new client, to prevent some exigency from happening. In fact, the best way to get what we want might be to reexamine those desires in the first place. Or it might be to aim for something else
          entirely, and use the impediment as an opportunity to explore a new direction. In doing so, we might end up creating a new venture that replaces our insufficient income entirely. Or we might discover that in ignoring clients, we attract
          more&mdash;finding that they want to work with someone who does not so badly want to work with them. Or we rethink that disaster we feared (along with everyone else) and come up with a way to profit from it when and if it happens.<br />
          We wrongly assume that moving forward is the only way to progress, the only way we can win. Sometimes, staying put, going sideways, or moving backward is actually the best way to eliminate what blocks or impedes your path.</p>

        <p>We can use the things that block us to our advantage, letting them do the difficult work for us. Sometimes this means leaving the obstacle as is, instead of trying so hard to change it.</p>

        <h4>CHANNEL YOUR ENERGY</h4>

        <p>Adversity can harden you. Or it can loosen you up and make you better&mdash;if you let it.<br />
          We all have our own constraints to deal with&mdash;rules and social norms we&rsquo;re required to observe that we&rsquo;d rather not. Dress codes, protocols, procedures, legal obligations, and company hierarchies that are all telling us how
          we have to behave. Think about it too much and it can start to feel oppressive, even suffocating. If we&rsquo;re not careful, this is likely to throw us off our game.<br />
          Instead of giving in to frustration, we can put it to good use. It can power our actions, which, unlike our disposition, become stronger and better when loose and bold. While others obsess with observing the rules, we&rsquo;re subtly
          undermining them and subverting them to our advantage. Think water. When dammed by a man-made obstacle, it does not simply sit stagnant. Instead, its energy is stored and deployed, fueling the power plants that run entire cities.</p>

        <p>And yet we feel like going to pieces when the PowerPoint projector won&rsquo;t work (instead of throwing it aside and delivering an exciting talk without notes). We stir up gossip with our coworkers (instead of pounding something
          productive out on our keyboards). We act out, instead of act.</p>

        <p>External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward.<br />
          What setbacks in our lives could resist that elegant, fluid, and powerful mastery?<br />
          To be physically and mentally loose takes no talent. That&rsquo;s just recklessness. <br />
          To be physically and mentally tight? That&rsquo;s called anxiety. It doesn&rsquo;t work, either. Eventually we snap. <em>But physical looseness combined with mental restraint? That is powerful.</em><br />
          It&rsquo;s a power that drives our opponents and competitors nuts. They think we&rsquo;re toying with them. It&rsquo;s maddening&mdash;like we aren&rsquo;t even trying, like we&rsquo;ve tuned out the world. Like we&rsquo;re immune to
          external stressors and limitations on the march toward our goals.<br />
          Because we are.</p>

        <h4>SEIZE THE OFFENSIVE</h4>

        <p>You always planned to do something. Write a screenplay. Travel. Start a business. Approach a possible mentor. Launch a movement.<br />
          Well, now something has happened&mdash;some disruptive event like a failure or an accident or a tragedy. Use it.<br />
          Perhaps you&rsquo;re stuck in bed recovering. Well, now you have time to write. Perhaps your emotions are overwhelming and painful, turn it into material. You lost your job or a relationship? That&rsquo;s awful, but now you can travel
          unencumbered. You&rsquo;re having a problem? Now you know exactly what to approach that mentor about. Seize this moment to deploy the plan that has long sat dormant in your head.</p>

        <p>Ordinary people shy away from negative situations, just as they do with failure. They do their best to avoid trouble. What great people do is the opposite. They are their best in these situations. They turn personal tragedy or
          misfortune&mdash;really anything, everything&mdash;to their advantage.<br />
          But this crisis in front of you? You&rsquo;re wasting it feeling sorry for yourself, feeling tired or disappointed. You forget: Life speeds on the bold and favors the brave.<br />
          We sit here and complain that we&rsquo;re not being given opportunities or chances. But we are.<br />
          At certain moments in our brief existences we are faced with great trials. Often those trials are frustrating, unfortunate, or unfair. They seem to come exactly when we think we need them the least. The question is: Do we accept this as an
          exclusively negative event, or can we get past whatever negativity or adversity it represents and mount an offensive? Or more precisely, can we see that this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; presents an opportunity for a solution that we have long
          been waiting for?</p>

        <h4>PREPARE FOR NONE OF IT TO WORK</h4>

        <p><em>It&rsquo;s an infinitely elastic formula: In every situation, that which blocks our path actually presents a new path with a new part of us.</em> If someone you love hurts you, there is a chance to practice forgiveness. If your
          business fails, now you can practice acceptance. If there is nothing else you can do for yourself, at least you can try to help others.</p>

        <h3>PART 3<br />WILL</h3>

        <h4>BUILD YOUR INNER CITADEL</h4>
        <p>We take weakness for granted. We assume that the way we&rsquo;re born is the way we simply are, that our disadvantages are permanent. And then we atrophy from there.</p>
        <p>Not everyone accepts their bad start in life. They remake their bodies and their lives with activities and exercise. They prepare themselves for the hard road. Do they hope they never have to walk it? Sure. But they are prepared for it in
          any case.</p>
        <p>Nobody is born with a steel backbone. We have to forge that ourselves.<br />
          <em>We craft our spiritual strength through physical exercise, and our physical hardiness through mental practice</em> (<i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>&mdash;sound mind in a strong body).
        </p>

        <h4>ANTICIPATION (THINKING NEGATIVELY)</h4>

        [expecting that bad things may happen and preparing in advance for adversity]

        <p>About the worst thing that can happen is not something going wrong, but something going wrong and catching you by surprise.</p>
        <p>But the person who has rehearsed in their mind what could go wrong will not be caught by surprise. The person ready to be disappointed won&rsquo;t be. They will have the strength to bear it. They are not as likely to get discouraged or to
          shirk from the task that lies before them, or make a mistake in the face of it.</p>
        <div class="important">
          <h4>You know what&rsquo;s better than building things up in your imagination?<br /> Building things up in real life.</h4>
        </div>

        <h4>THE ART OF ACQUIESCENCE</h4>

        <p>The way life is gives you plenty to work with, plenty to leave your imprint on. Taking people and events as they are is quite enough material already. Follow where the events take you&#8230;</p>

        <h4>LOVE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS: <i>AMOR FATI</i></h4>

        <blockquote class="important">
          <h4>My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it... but love it.</h4>
          <p class="author">NIETZSCHE</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>PERSEVERANCE</h4>
        <p>When Antonio Pigafetta, the assistant to Magellan on his trip around the world, reflected on his boss&rsquo;s greatest and most admirable skill, what do you think he said? It had nothing to do with sailing. The secret to his success,
          Pigafetta said, was Magellan&rsquo;s ability to endure hunger better than the other men.</p>

        <h4>SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF</h4>

        <p>People are getting a little desperate. People might not show their best elements to you. <em>You must never lower yourself to being a person you don&rsquo;t like.</em> There is no better time than now to have a moral and civic backbone. To
          have a moral and civic true north. This is a tremendous opportunity for you, a young person, to be heroic.</p>

        <h4>MEDITATE ON YOUR MORTALITY</h4>

        <p>In the shadow of death, prioritization is easier. As are graciousness and appreciation and principles. Everything falls in its proper place and perspective. Why would you do the wrong thing? Why feel fear? Why let yourself and others down?
          Life will be over soon enough; death chides us that we may as well do life right.<br />
          We can learn to adjust and come to terms with death&mdash;this final and most humbling fact of life&mdash;and find relief in the understanding that there is nothing else nearly as hard left.<br />
          <em>And so, if even our own mortality can have some benefit, how dare you say that you can&rsquo;t derive value from each and every other kind of obstacle you encounter?</em>
        </p>

        <h4>PREPARE TO START AGAIN</h4>
        <p>The great law of nature is that it never stops. There is no end. Just when you think you&rsquo;ve successfully navigated one obstacle, another emerges.<br />
          But that&rsquo;s what keeps life interesting. And as you&rsquo;re starting to see, that&rsquo;s what creates opportunities.<br />
          <br />
          Each time, you&rsquo;ll learn something. Each time, you&rsquo;ll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective. Each time, a little more of the competition falls away. Until all that is left is you: the best version of you.<br />
          <br />
          ...the more you accomplish, the more things will stand in your way. There are always more obstacles, bigger challenges. You&rsquo;re always fighting uphill. Get used to it and train accordingly.<br />
          Knowing that life is a marathon and not a sprint is important. Conserve your energy. <em>Understand that each battle is only one of many</em> and that you can use it to make the next one easier.
        </p>

        <p><em>Passing one obstacle simply says you&rsquo;re worthy of more.</em> The world seems to keep throwing them at you once it knows you can take it. Which is good, because we get better with every attempt.<br />
          Never rattled. Never frantic. Always hustling and acting with creativity. Never anything but deliberate. Never attempting to do the impossible&mdash;but everything up to that line.<br />
          Simply flipping the obstacles that life throws at you by improving in spite of them, because of them.<br />
          And therefore no longer afraid. But excited, cheerful, and eagerly anticipating the next round.</p>

        <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>

        <p>To be sure, no one is saying you&rsquo;ve got to do it all at once. Margaret Thatcher didn&rsquo;t become known as the Iron Lady until she was sixty years old. There&rsquo;s a saying in Latin: <i>Vires acquirit eundo</i> <em>(We gather
            strength as we go)</em>. That&rsquo;s how it works. That&rsquo;s our motto.<br />
