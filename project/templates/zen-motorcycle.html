{% block inner_content %}

<p>I'm happy to be riding back into this country. It is a kind of nowhere, famous for nothing at all and has an appeal because of just that.</p>

<p>At age eleven you don't get very impressed with red-winged blackbirds.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You have to get older for that.</p>

<p>You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is
  just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming. That concrete whizzing by five inches below your
  foot is the real thing, the same stuff you walk on, it's right there, so blurred you can't focus on it, yet you can put your foot down and touch it anytime, and the whole thing, the whole experience, is never removed from immediate
  consciousness.</p>

<p> Plans are deliberately indefinite, more to travel than to arrive anywhere.</p>

<p>We want to make good time, but for us now this is measured with emphasis on &ldquo;good&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;time&rdquo; and when you make that shift in emphasis the whole approach changes.</p>

<p>Roads with little traffic are more enjoyable, as well as safer. Roads free of drive-ins and billboards are better, roads where groves and meadows and orchards and lawns come almost to the shoulder, where kids wave to you when you ride by,
  where people look from their porches to see who it is, where when you stop to ask directions or information the answer tends to be longer than you want rather than short, where people ask where you're from and how long you've been riding.
</p>

<p>It was a puzzling thing. The truth knocks on the door and you say, &ldquo;Go away, I'm looking for the truth,&rdquo; and so it goes away. Puzzling.</p>

<p>Unless you're fond of hollering you don't make great conversations on a running cycle. Instead you spend your time being aware of things and meditating on them. On sights and sounds, on the mood of the weather and things remembered, on the
  machine and the countryside you're in, thinking about things at great leisure and length without being hurried and without feeling you're losing time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's new?&rdquo; is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively, results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to be concerned with
  the question &ldquo;What is best?,&rdquo; a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream. </p>

<p> The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha
  which is to demean oneself. </p>

<p> I argued that physical discomfort is important only when the mood is wrong. Then you fasten on to whatever thing is uncomfortable and call that the cause. But if the mood is right, then physical discomfort doesn't mean much. </p>

<p> After a while he says, &ldquo;Do you believe in ghosts?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;No,&rdquo; I say <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Why not?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Because they are un-sci-en-ti-fic.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The way I say this makes John smile. &ldquo;They contain no matter,&rdquo; I continue, &ldquo;and have no energy and therefore, according to the laws of science, do not exist except in people's minds.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The whiskey, the fatigue and the wind in the trees start mixing in my mind. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I add, &ldquo;the laws of science contain no matter and have no energy either and therefore do not exist except in
  people's minds. It's best to be completely scientific about the whole thing and refuse to believe in either ghosts or the laws of science. That way you're safe. That doesn't leave you very much to believe in, but that's scientific
  too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#160;&rdquo;My own opinion is that the intellect of modern man isn't that superior. IQs aren't that much different. Those Indians and medieval men were just as intelligent as we are, but the context in which they thought was completely
  different. Within that context of thought, ghosts and spirits are quite as real as atoms, particles, photons and quants are to a modern man. In that sense I believe in ghosts. Modern man has his ghosts and spirits too, you know.&rdquo;
  <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;What?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Oh, the laws of physics and of logic-the number system-the principle of algebraic substitution. These are ghosts. We just believe in them so thoroughly they seem real. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;They seem real to me,&rdquo; John says. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;I don't get it,&rdquo; says Chris. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So I go on. &ldquo;For example, it seems completely natural to presume that gravitation and the law of gravitation existed before Isaac Newton. It would sound nutty to think that until the seventeenth century there
  was no gravity.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Of course.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;So when did this law start? Has it always existed?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John is frowning, wondering what I am getting at. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;What I'm driving at,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;is the notion that before the beginning of the earth, before the sun and the stars were formed, before the primal generation of anything, the law of gravity
  existed.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Sure.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Sitting there, having no mass of its own, no energy of its own, not in anyone's mind because there wasn't anyone, not in space because there was no space either, not anywhere this law of gravity still
  existed?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now John seems not so sure. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;If that law of gravity existed,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I honestly don't know what a thing has to do to be nonexistent. It seems to me that law of gravity has passed every test of nonexistence there is. You
  cannot think of a single attribute of nonexistence that that law of gravity didn't have. Or a single scientific attribute of existence it did have. And yet it is still common sense to believe that it existed.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John says, &ldquo;I guess I'd have to think about it.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Well, I predict that if you think about it long enough you will find yourself going round and round and round and round until you finally reach only one possible, rational, intelligent conclusion. The law of
  gravity and gravity itself did not exist before Isaac Newton. No other conclusion makes sense. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;And what that means,&rdquo; I say before he can interrupt, &ldquo;and what that means is that that law of gravity exists nowhere except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and
  conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Why does everybody believe in the law of gravity then?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as education.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>&rdquo;But I'll repeat it for you,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;We believe the disembodied words of Sir Isaac Newton were sitting in the middle of nowhere billions of years before he was born and that magically he discovered these words. They were
  always there, even when they applied to nothing. Gradually the world came into being and then they applied to it. In fact, those words themselves were what formed the world. That, John, is ridiculous.&rdquo; <br />
  &rdquo;The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist only in the mind. I
  don't get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the mind. It's that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it's just that that doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They are just looking at me so I continue: &ldquo;Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts. The whole blessed thing is a human invention,
  including the idea that it isn't a human invention. The world has no existence whatsoever outside the human imagination. It's all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed world we live in. It's run by
  ghosts. We see what we see because these ghosts show it to us, ghosts of Moses and Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good ghost. One of the
  best. Your common sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghosts from the past. Ghosts and more ghosts. Ghosts trying to find their place among the living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If someone's ungrateful and you tell him he's ungrateful, okay, you've called him a name. You haven't solved anything.</p>

<p> &ldquo;It's so beautiful. It's so empty.&rdquo; (Sylvia)</p>

<p> &rdquo;When are we going to get going?&rdquo; Chris says. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;What's your hurry?&rdquo; I ask. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;I just want to get going.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;There's nothing up ahead that's any better than it is right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You follow these little discrepancies long enough and they sometimes open up into huge revelations.</p>

<p>&#160;And in the fog there appears an intimation of a figure. It disappears when I look at it directly, but then reappears in the corner of my vision when I turn my glance. I am about to say something, to call to it, to recognize it, but
  then do not, knowing that to recognize it by any gesture or action is to give it a reality which it must not have. </p>

<p>Barren hills, no one anywhere, not a sound; and there is something about places like this that raises your spirits a little and makes you think that things will probably get better.</p>

<p>The fourth is that there is a knife moving here. A very deadly one; an intellectual scalpel so swift and so sharp you sometimes don't see it moving. You get the illusion that all those parts are just there and are being named as they
  exist. But they can be named quite differently and organized quite differently depending on how the knife moves.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, the feedback mechanism which includes the camshaft and cam chain and tappets and distributor exists only because of an unusual cut of this analytic knife. If you were to go to a motorcycle-parts
  department and ask them for a feedback assembly they wouldn't know what the hell you were talking about. They don&#146;t split it up that way. No two manufacturers ever split it up quite the same way and every mechanic is familiar with the
  problem of the part you can't buy because you can't find it because the manufacturer considers it a part of something else. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is important to see this knife for what it is and not to be fooled into thinking that motorcycles or anything else are the way they are just because the knife happened to cut it up that way. It is important to
  concentrate on the knife itself. Later I will want to show how an ability to use this knife creatively and effectively can result in solutions to the classic and romantic split. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Phaedrus was a master with this knife, and used it with dexterity and a sense of power. With a single stroke of analytic thought he split the whole world into parts of his own choosing, split the parts and split the
  fragments of the parts, finer and finer and finer until he had reduced it to what he wanted it to be. Even the special use of the terms &ldquo;classic&rdquo; and &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; are examples of his knifemanship.</p>

<p>I should talk now about Phaedrus' knife. It'll help understand some of the things we talked about. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The application of this knife, the division of the world into parts and the building of this structure, is something everybody does. All the time we are aware of millions of things around us - these changing shapes,
  these burning hills, the sound of the engine, the feel of the throttle, each rock and weed and fence post and piece of debris beside the road - aware of these things but not really conscious of them unless there is something unusual or
  unless they reflect something we are predisposed to see. We could not possibly be conscious of these things and remember all of them because our mind would be so full of useless details we would be unable to think. From all this awareness
  we must select, and what we select and call consciousness is never the same as the awareness because the process of selection mutates it. We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of
  sand the world. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once we have the handful of sand, the world of which we are conscious, a process of discrimination goes to work on it. This is the knife. We divide the sand into parts. This and that. Here and there. Black and white.
  Now and then. The discrimination is the division of the conscious universe into parts. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The handful of sand looks uniform at first, but the longer we look at it the more diverse we find it to be. Each grain of sand is different. No two are alike. Some are similar in one way, some are similar in another
  way, and we can form the sand into separate piles on the basis of this similarity and dissimilarity. Shades of color in different piles, sizes in different piles, grain shapes in different piles, subtypes of grain shapes in different piles,
  grades of opacity in different piles, and so on, and on, and on. You'd think the process of subdivision and classification would come to an end somewhere, but it doesn't. It just goes on and on.<br />
  &#160; Classical understanding is concerned with the piles and the basis for sorting and interrelating them. Romantic understanding is directed toward the handful of sand before the sorting begins. Both are valid ways of looking at the
  world although irreconcilable with each other.<br />
  What has become an urgent necessity is a way of looking at the world that does violence to neither of these two kinds of understanding and unites them into one. Such an understanding will not reject sand-sorting or contemplation of unsorted
  sand for its own sake. Such an understanding will instead seek to direct attention to the endless landscape from which the sand is taken. </p>

<p>There is a perennial classical question that asks which part of the motorcycle, which grain of sand in which pile, is the Buddha. Obviously to ask that question is to look in the wrong direction, for the Buddha is everywhere. But just as
  obviously to ask that question is to look in the right direction, for the Buddha is everywhere. About the Buddha that exists independently of any analytic thought much has been said some would say too much, and would question any attempt to
  add to it. But about the Buddha that exists within analytic thought, and gives that analytic thought its direction, virtually nothing has been said, and there are historic reasons for this. ...<br />
  When analytic thought, the knife, is applied to experience, something is always killed in the process. That is fairly well understood, at least in the arts. Mark Twain's experience comes to mind, in which, after he had mastered the analytic
  knowledge needed to pilot the Mississippi River, he discovered the river had lost its beauty. Something is always killed. But what is less noticed in the arts something is always created too. And instead of just dwelling on what is killed
  it's important also to see what's created and to see the process as a kind of death-birth continuity that is neither good nor bad, but just is.</p>

<p>...to get at Phaedrus, this oblique route is the only one to take. To describe his physical appearance or the statistics of his life would be to dwell on misleading superficialities.</p>

<p>No one then would see the ghost that Phaedrus pursued, but I think now that more and more people see it, or get glimpses of it in bad moments, a ghost which calls itself rationality but whose appearance is that of incoherence and
  meaninglessness, which causes the most normal of everyday acts to seem slightly mad because of their irrelevance to anything else. This is the ghost of normal everyday assumptions which declares that the ultimate purpose of life, which is
  to keep alive, is impossible, but that this is the ultimate purpose of life anyway, so that great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may live longer, but only madmen ask why. One lives longer in order that he may live longer.
  There is no other purpose.</p>

<p>&#160;To speak of certain government and establishment institutions as &ldquo;the system&rdquo; is to speak correctly, since these organizations are founded upon the same structural conceptual relationships as a motorcycle. They are
  sustained by structural relationships even when they have lost all other meaning and purpose. People arrive at a factory and perform a totally meaningless task from eight to five without question because the structure demands that it be
  that way. There's no villain, no &ldquo;mean guy&rdquo; who wants them to live meaningless lives, it's just that the structure, the system demands it and no one is willing to take on the formidable task of changing the structure just
  because it is meaningless.</p>
<p class="important">But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is
  possible. The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will
  simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government.
  There's so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.</p>
&#160;&#160;That's all the motorcycle is, a system of concepts worked out in steel. There's no part in it, no shape in it, that is not out of someone's mind... I've noticed that people who have never worked with steel have trouble seeing this
- that the motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon. ...These shapes are all out of someone's mind. That's important to see. The steel? Hell, even the steel is out of someone's mind. There's no steel in nature. Anyone from the Bronze Age
could have told you that. All nature has is a potential for steel. There's nothing else there. But what's &ldquo;potential&rdquo;? That's also in someone's mind! - Ghosts. </p>

<p>But until then, and right now, the sun is bright, the air is cool, my head is clear, there's a whole day ahead of us, we're almost to the mountains, it's a good day to be alive. It's this thinner air that does it. You always feel like this
  when you start getting into higher altitudes.</p>

<p>The TV scientist who mutters sadly, &ldquo;The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for,&rdquo; is suffering mainly from a bad scriptwriter.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;If the purpose of scientific method is to select from among a multitude of hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle, then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested.
  If all hypotheses cannot be tested, then the results of any experiment are inconclusive and the entire scientific method falls short of its goal of establishing proven knowledge. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About this Einstein had said, &ldquo;Evolution has shown that at any given moment out of all conceivable constructions a single one has always proved itself absolutely superior to the rest,&rdquo; and let it go at
  that. But to Phaedrus that was an incredibly weak answer. The phrase &ldquo;at any given moment&rdquo; really shook him. Did Einstein really mean to state that truth was a function of time? To state that would annihilate the most basic
  presumption of all science!<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there it was, the whole history of science, a clear story of continuously new and changing explanations of old facts. The time spans of permanence seemed completely random he could see no order in them. Some
  scientific truths seemed to last for centuries, others for less than a year. Scientific truth was not dogma, good for eternity, but a temporal quantitative entity that could be studied like anything else.</p>

<p class="important">It looked as though the time spans of scientific truths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort. Thus the scientific truths of the twentieth century seem to have a much shorter life-span than those
  of the last century because scientific activity is now much greater. If, in the next century, scientific activity increases tenfold, then the life expectancy of any scientific truth can be expected to drop to perhaps one-tenth as long as
  now. What shortens the life-span of the existing truth is the volume of hypotheses offered to replace it; the more the hypotheses, the shorter the time span of the truth. And what seems to be causing the number of hypotheses to grow in
  recent decades seems to be nothing other than scientific method itself. The more you look, the more you see. Instead of selecting one truth from a multitude you are increasing the multitude. What this means logically is that as you try to
  move toward unchanging truth through the application of scientific method, you actually do not move toward it at all. You move away from it! It is your application of scientific method that is causing it to change!</p>

<p>The purpose of scientific method is to select a single truth from among many hypothetical truths. That, more than anything else, is what science is all about. But historically science has done exactly the opposite. <em>Through
    multiplication upon multiplication of facts, information, theories and hypotheses, it is science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones.</em> The major producer of the social
  chaos, the indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge is supposed to eliminate, is none other than science itself. And what Phaedrus saw in the isolation of his own laboratory work years ago is now seen everywhere in the
  technological world today. Scientifically produced antiscience chaos.</p>

<p>...failed to understand or misunderstood what he said.</p>

<p>He felt that institutions such as schools, churches, governments and political organizations of every sort all tended to direct thought for ends other than truth, for the perpetuation of their own functions, and for the control of
  individuals in the service of these functions.</p>

<p>Ancient wars were committed with far less moral justification than modern ones. [duh!]</p>

<p>His work was just barely passing by academic standards at this time, but this wasn't because he wasn't working or thinking. He was thinking too hard, and the harder you think in this high country of the mind the slower you go. Phaedrus
  read in a scientific way rather than a literary way, testing each sentence as he went along, noting doubts and questions to be resolved later, and I'm fortunate in having a whole trunkful of volumes of these notations.</p>

<p>The school was what could euphemistically be called a &ldquo;teaching college.&rdquo; At a teaching college you teach and you teach and you teach with no time for research, no time for contemplation, no time for participation in outside
  affairs. Just teach and teach and teach until your mind grows dull and your creativity vanishes and you become an automaton saying the same dull things over and over to endless waves of innocent students who cannot understand why you are so
  dull, lose respect and fan this disrespect out into the community. </p>

<p>&#160;&#160;It began with reference to a newspaper article about a country church building with an electric beer sign hanging right over the front entrance. The building had been sold and was being used as a bar. One can guess that some
  classroom laughter started at this point. The college was well known for drunken partying and the image vaguely fit. The article said a number of people had complained to the church officials about it. It had been a Catholic church, and the
  priest who had been delegated to respond to the criticism had sounded quite irritated about the whole thing. To him it had revealed an incredible ignorance of what a church really was. Did they think that bricks and boards and glass
  constituted a church? Or the shape of the roof? Here, posing as piety was an example of the very materialism the church opposed. The building in question was not holy ground. It had been desanctified. That was the end of it. The beer sign
  resided over a bar, not a church, and those who couldn't tell the difference were simply revealing something about themselves.</p>

<p>The real University is a state of mind.</p>

<p>You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or
  religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.</p>

<p> It's not the technology that's scary. It's what it does to the relations between people, like callers and operators, that's scary.</p>

<p>I realize that although this is the authentic image of DeWeese himself, it's also a brand-new person who's been renewing himself continually and I'm going to have to get to know him all over again.</p>

<p>It's an old split. Like the one between art and art history. One does it and the other talks about how it's done and the talk about how it's done never seems to match how one does it.</p>

<p>&#160;&rdquo;What I wanted to say,&rdquo; I finally get in, &ldquo;is that I've a set of instructions at home which open up great realms for the improvement of technical writing. They begin, <em>Assembly of Japanese bicycle require great
    peace of mind.</em> &ldquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This produces more laughter, but Sylvia and Gennie and the sculptor give sharp looks of recognition. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;That's a good instruction,&rdquo; the sculptor says. Gennie nods too. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;That's kind of why I saved it,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;At first I laughed because of memories of bicycles I'd put together and, of course, the unintended slur on Japanese manufacture. But there's a lot of wisdom
  in that statement.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John looks at me apprehensively. I look at him with equal apprehension. We both laugh. He says, &ldquo;The professor will now expound.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Peace of mind isn't at all superficial, really,&rdquo; I expound. &ldquo;It's the whole thing. That which produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance. What we call workability
  of the machine is just an objectification of this peace of mind. The ultimate test's always your own serenity. If you don't have this when you start and maintain it while you're working you're likely to build your personal problems right
  into the machine itself.&rdquo;<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They just look at me, thinking about this. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;It's an unconventional concept,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;but conventional reason bears it out. The material object of observation, the bicycle or rotisserie, can't be right or wrong. Molecules are molecules. They
  don't have any ethical codes to follow except those people give them. The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. There isn't any other test. If the machine produces tranquility it's right. If it disturbs you it's wrong until
  either the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine's always your own mind. There isn't any other test.&rdquo;<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  &rdquo;These rotisserie instructions begin and end exclusively with the machine. But the kind of approach I'm thinking about doesn't cut it off so narrowly. What's really angering about instructions of this sort is that they imply there's
  only one way to put this rotisserie together - their way. And that presumption wipes out all the creativity. Actually there are hundreds of ways to put the rotisserie together and when they make you follow just one way without showing you
  the overall problem the instructions become hard to follow in such a way as not to make mistakes. You lose feeling for the work. And not only that, it's very unlikely that they've told you the best way.&rdquo;<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  &rdquo;Technology presumes there's just one right way to do things and there never is. And when you presume there's just one right way to do things, of course the instructions begin and end exclusively with the rotisserie. But if you have
  to choose among an infinite number of ways to put it together then the relation of the machine to you, and the relation of the machine and you to the rest of the world, has to be considered, because the selection from many choices, the art
  of the work is just as dependent upon your own mind and spirit as it is upon the material of the machine. That's why you need the peace of mind.&rdquo;<br />
  &#160;&rdquo;Actually this idea isn't so strange,&rdquo; I continue. &ldquo;Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you'll see the
  difference. The craftsman isn't ever following a single line of instruction. He's making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he'll be absorbed and attentive to what he's doing even though he doesn't deliberately contrive this. His
  motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn't following any set of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material at
  hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of changes until his mind's at rest at the same time the material's right.&rdquo; <br />

<p> &ldquo;You look at where you're going and where you are and it never makes sense, but then you look back at where you've been and a pattern seems to emerge. And if you project forward from that pattern, then sometimes you can come up with
  something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;The trouble is that essays always have to sound like God talking for eternity, and that isn't the way it ever is. People should see that it's never anything other than just one person talking from one place in time and space and

<p> It seemed as though every rule he honestly tried to discover with them and learn with them was so full of exceptions and contradictions and qualifications and confusions that he wished he'd never come across the rule in the first
  place.<br />
  ...<br />
  And what he really thought was that the rule was pasted on to the writing after the writing was all done. It was post hoc, after the fact, instead of prior to the fact. And he became convinced that all the writers the students were supposed
  to mimic wrote without rules, putting down whatever sounded right, then going back to see if it still sounded right and changing it if it didn't. </p>

<p>Like those in the valley behind us, most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them, being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships. Some travel into the
  mountains accompanied by experienced guides who know the best and least dangerous routes by which they arrive at their destination. Still others, inexperienced and untrusting, attempt to make their own routes. Few of these are successful,
  but occasionally some, by sheer will and luck and grace, do make it. Once there they become more aware than any of the others that there's no single or fixed number of routes. There are as many routes as there are individual souls.</p>

<p>She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard, just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say. She couldn't think of anything to write about Bozeman
  because she couldn't recall anything she had heard worth repeating. She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself, as she wrote, without primary regard for what had been said before.</p>

<p>Schools teach you to imitate. If you don't imitate what the teacher wants you get a bad grade. Here, in college, it was more sophisticated, of course; you were supposed to imitate the teacher in such a way as to convince the teacher you
  were not imitating, but taking the essence of the instruction and going ahead with it on your own. That got you A&#146;s. Originality on the other hand could get you anything from A to F. The whole grading system cautioned against it.
  <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He discussed this with a professor of psychology who lived next door to him, an extremely imaginative teacher, who said, &ldquo;Right. Eliminate the whole degree-and-grading system and then you'll get real
  education.&rdquo;&#160;
</p>

<p>
  &#160;The demonstrator was an argument that elimination of grades and degrees would destroy this hypocrisy. Rather than deal with generalities it dealt with the specific career of an imaginary student who more or less typified what was
  found in the classroom, a student completely conditioned to work for a grade rather than for the knowledge the grade was supposed to represent. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a student, the demonstrator hypothesized, would go to his first class, get his first assignment and probably do it out of habit. He might go to his second and third as well. But eventually the novelty of the
  course would wear off and, because his academic life was not his only life, the pressure of other obligations or desires would create circumstances where he just would not be able to get an assignment in. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since there was no degree or grading system he would incur no penalty for this. Subsequent lectures which presumed he'd completed the assignment might be a little more difficult to understand, however, and this
  difficulty, in turn, might weaken his interest to a point where the next assignment, which he would find quite hard, would also be dropped. Again no penalty.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time his weaker and weaker understanding of what the lectures were about would make it more and more difficult for him to pay attention in class. Eventually he would see he wasn't learning much; and facing the
  continual pressure of outside obligations, he would stop studying, feel guilty about this and stop attending class. Again, no penalty would be attached. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what had happened? The student, with no hard feelings on anybody's part, would have flunked himself out. Good! This is what should have happened. He wasn't there for a real education in the first place and had no
  real business there at all. A large amount of money and effort had been saved and there would be no stigma of failure and ruin to haunt him the rest of his life. No bridges had been burned. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The student's biggest problem was a slave mentality which had been built into him by years of carrot-and-whip grading, a mule mentality which said, &ldquo;If you don't whip me, I won't work.&rdquo; He didn't get
  whipped. He didn't work. And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, &ldquo;the system,&rdquo; is pulled by mules. This is a common, vocational, &ldquo;location&rdquo; point of view, but it's not the Church
  attitude. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Church attitude is that civilization, or &ldquo;the system&rdquo; or &ldquo;society&rdquo; or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and
  degrees is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while. He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he'd abandoned, in what used to be called the &ldquo;school of hard
  knocks.&rdquo; Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic. Actually his real status would go up. He would be making a contribution for a change. Maybe
  that's what he would do for the rest of his life. Maybe he'd found his level. But don't count on it. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time - six months; five years, perhaps - a change could easily begin to take place. He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shopwork. His creative intelligence, stifled by too much
  theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop. Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design. He would like to design machinery
  himself. He'd think he could do a better job. He would try modifying a few engines,<br />
  meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn't have the theoretical information. He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he'd now find a
  brand of theoretical information which he'd have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So he would come back to our degreeless and gradeless school, but with a difference. He'd no longer be a grade-motivated person. He'd be a knowledge-motivated person. He would need no external pushing to learn. His
  push would come from inside. He'd be a free man. He wouldn't need a lot of discipline to shape him up. In fact, if the instructors assigned him were slacking on the job he would be likely to shape them up by asking rude questions. He'd be
  there to learn something, would be paying to learn something and they'd better come up with it. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force, and in the gradeless, degreeless institution where our student would find himself, he wouldn't stop with rote engineering information. Physics and
  mathematics were going to come within his sphere of interest because he'd see he needed them. Metallurgy and electrical engineering would come up for attention. And, in the process of intellectual maturing that these abstract studies gave
  him, he would he likely to branch out into other theoretical areas that weren't directly related to machines but had become a part of a newer larger goal. This larger goal wouldn't be the imitation of education in Universities today,
  glossed over and concealed by grades and degrees that give the appearance of something happening when, in fact, almost nothing is going on. It would be the real thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of us got together outside of class to try to figure out how to beat this system. Everyone decided the best way was just to figure you were going to fail and then go ahead and do what you could anyway. Then you start to relax.
  Otherwise you go out of your mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The movement from this to his enquiry into Quality took place because of a sinister aspect of grading that the withholding of grades exposed. Grades really cover up failure to teach. A bad instructor can go through an entire quarter
  leaving absolutely nothing memorable in the minds of his class, curve out the scores on an irrelevant test, and leave the impression that some have learned and some have not. But if the grades are removed the class is forced to wonder each
  day what it's really learning. The questions, What's being taught? What's the goal? How do the lectures and assignments accomplish the goal? become ominous. The removal of grades exposes a huge and frightening vacuum. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What was Phaedrus trying to do, anyway? This question became more and more imperative as he went on. The answer that had seemed right when he started now made less and less sense. He had wanted his students to become
  creative by deciding for themselves what was good writing instead of asking him all the time. The real purpose of withholding the grades was to force them to look within themselves, the only place they would ever get a really right answer.
  <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now this made no sense. If they already knew what was good and bad, there was no reason for them to take the course in the first place. The fact that they were there as students presumed they did not know what
  was good or bad. That was his job as instructor - to tell them what was good or bad. The whole idea of individual creativity and expression in the classroom was really basically opposed to the whole idea of the University. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For many of the students, this withholding created a Kafkaesque situation in which they saw they were to be punished for failure to do something but no one would tell them what they were supposed to do. They looked
  within themselves and saw nothing and looked at Phaedrus and saw nothing and just sat there helpless, not knowing what to do. The vacuum was deadly. One girl suffered a nervous breakdown. You cannot withhold grades and sit there and create
  a goalless vacuum. You have to provide some goal for a class to work toward that will fill that vacuum. This he wasn't doing. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He couldn't. He could think of no possible way he could tell them what they should work toward without falling back into the trap of authoritarian, didactic teaching. But how can you put on the blackboard the
  mysterious internal goal of each creative person?
</p>

<p>Mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and without desire. The reality of your own nature should determine the speed. If you become restless, speed up. If you become winded, slow down. You climb the mountain in an
  equilibrium between restlessness and exhaustion. Then, when you're no longer thinking ahead, each footstep isn't just a means to an end but a unique event in itself. This leaf has jagged edges. This rock looks loose. From this place the
  snow is less visible, even though closer. These are things you should notice anyway. To live only for some future goal is shallow. It's the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here's where things grow.<br />
  But of course, without the top you can't have any sides. It's the top that defines the sides. </p>

<p>Mental reflection is so much more interesting than TV it's a shame more people don't switch over to it.</p>

<p> &ldquo;We just accidentally stumbled over a genuine question, and the shock is hard to recover from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any effort that has self-glorification as its final endpoint is bound to end in disaster. Now we're paying the price. When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do it's a hollow
  victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find
  out. That's never the way.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical. Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested. But
  what a difference! The ego-climber is like an instrument that&rsquo;s out of adjustment. He puts his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He&rsquo;s likely to miss a beautiful passage of sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the
  sloppiness of his step shows he&rsquo;s tired. He rests at odd times. He looks up the trail trying to see what&rsquo;s ahead even when he knows what&rsquo;s ahead because he just looked a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the
  conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else, something else. He&rsquo;s here but he&rsquo;s not here. He rejects the here, he&rsquo;s unhappy with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be
  just as unhappy because then *it* will be &ldquo;here&rdquo;. What he&rsquo;s looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he doesn&rsquo;t want that because it *is* all around him. Every step&rsquo;s an effort, both physically and
  spiritually, because he imagines his goal to be external and distant.</p>

<p>When an ego-climber has an image of himself to protect he naturally lies to protect this image.</p>

<p>I think that the referent of a term that can split a world into hip and square, classic and romantic, technological and humanistic, is an entity that can unite a world already split along these lines into one. A real understanding of
  Quality doesn't just serve the System, or even beat it or even escape it. A real understanding of Quality captures the System, tames it, and puts it to work for one's own personal use, while leaving one completely free to fulfill his inner
  destiny.</p>

<p>It's an old rule of logic that the competence of a speaker has no relevance to the truth of what he says, and so talk of incompetence was pure sand.</p>

<p>Philosophical mysticism, the idea that truth is indefinable and can be apprehended only by nonrational means, has been with us since the beginning of history. It's the basis of Zen practice. But it's not an academic subject. The academy,
  the Church of Reason, is concerned exclusively with those things that can be defined, and if one wants to be a mystic, his place is in a monastery, not a University. Universities are places where things should be spelled out.</p>

<p>... &ldquo;What you like is bad, or at least inconsequential.&rdquo; What was behind this smug presumption that what pleased you was bad, or at least unimportant in comparison to other things? It seemed the quintessence of the squareness
  he was fighting. Little children were trained not to do &ldquo;just what they liked&rdquo; but-but what? - Of course! What others liked. And which others? Parents, teachers, supervisors, policemen, judges, officials, kings, dictators. All
  authorities. When you are trained to despise &ldquo;just what you like&rdquo; then, of course, you become a much more obedient servant of others - a good slave. When you learn not to do &ldquo;just what you like&rdquo; then the System loves
  you. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But suppose you do just what you like? Does that mean you're going to go out and shoot heroin, rob banks and rape old ladies? The person who is counseling you not to do &ldquo;just as you like&rdquo; is making some
  remarkable presumptions as to what is likable. He seems unaware that people may not rob banks because they have considered the consequences and decided they don't like to. He doesn't see that banks exist in the first place because they're
  &ldquo;just what people like,&rdquo; namely, providers of loans. Phaedrus began to wonder how all this condemnation of &ldquo;what you like&rdquo; ever seemed such a natural objection in the first place.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon he saw there was much more to this than he had been aware of. When people said, Don't do just what you like, they didn't just mean, Obey authority. They also meant something else. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This &ldquo;something else&rdquo; opened up into a huge area of classic scientific belief which stated that &ldquo;what you like&rdquo; is unimportant because it's all composed of irrational emotions within yourself.
  He studied this argument for a long time, then knifed it into two smaller groups which he called scientific materialism and classic formalism. He said the two are often found associated in the same person but logically are separate. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scientific materialism, which is commoner among lay followers of science than among scientists themselves, holds that what is composed of matter or energy and is measurable by the instruments of science is real.
  Anything else is unreal, or at least of no importance. &ldquo;What you like&rdquo; is unmeasurable, and therefore unreal. &ldquo;What you like&rdquo; can be a fact or it can be a hallucination. Liking does not distinguish between the two.
  The whole purpose of scientific method is to make valid distinctions between the false and the true in nature, to eliminate the subjective, unreal, imaginary elements from one's work so as to obtain an objective, true, picture of reality.
  When he said Quality was subjective, to them he was just saying Quality is imaginary and could therefore be disregarded in any serious consideration of reality. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand is classic formalism, which insists that what isn't understood intellectually isn't understood at all. Quality in this case is unimportant because it's an emotional understanding unaccompanied by
  the intellectual elements of reason.<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  And the arguments of classical formalism, when he started to examine them, made it even worse. These were the extremely forceful arguments that you shouldn't respond to your immediate emotional impulses without considering the big rational
  picture. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kids are told, &ldquo;Don't spend your whole allowance for bubble gum [immediate emotional impulse] because you're going to want to spend it for something else later [big picture].&rdquo; Adults are told, &ldquo;This
  paper mill may smell awful even with the best controls [immediate emotions], but without it the economy of the whole town will collapse [big picture].&rdquo; In terms of our old dichotomy, what's being said is, &ldquo;Don't base your
  decisions on romantic surface appeal without considering classical underlying form.&rdquo; This was something he kind of agreed with. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the classical formalists meant by the objection &ldquo;Quality is just what you like&rdquo; was that this subjective, undefined &ldquo;quality&rdquo; he was teaching was just romantic surface appeal. Classroom
  popularity contests could determine whether a composition had immediate appeal, all right, but was this Quality? Was Quality something that you &ldquo;just see&rdquo; or might it be something more subtle than that, so that you wouldn't see
  it at all immediately, but only after a long period of time?</p>

<p>And really, the Quality he was talking about wasn't classic Quality or romantic Quality. It was beyond both of them. And by God, it wasn't subjective or objective either, it was beyond both of those categories. Actually this whole dilemma
  of subjectivity-objectivity, of mind-matter, with relationship to Quality was unfair. That mind-matter relationship has been an intellectual hang-up for centuries. They were just putting that hang-up on top of Quality to drag Quality down.
  How could he say whether Quality was mind or matter when there was no logical clarity as to what was mind and what was matter in the first place? <br />
  And so: he rejected the left horn. Quality is not objective, he said. It doesn't reside in the material world. <br />
  Then: he rejected the right horn. Quality is not subjective, he said. It doesn't reside merely in the mind. <br />
  And finally: Phaedrus, following a path that to his knowledge had never been taken before in the history of Western thought, went straight between the horns of the subjectivity-objectivity dilemma and said Quality is neither a part of mind,
  nor is it a part of matter. It is a third entity which is independent of the two.<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  &#160;I don't know how much thought passed before he arrived at this, but eventually he saw that Quality couldn&#146;t be independently related with either the subject or the object but could be found only in the relationship of the two
  with each other. It is the point at which subject and object meet. [I've studied this in Aesthetic course at the University]<br />
  ...<br />
  Quality is not a thing. It is an event.<br />
  ... <br />
  It is the event at which the subject becomes aware of the object. <br />
  And because without objects there can be no subject - because the objects create the subject's awareness of himself - Quality is the event at which awareness of both subjects and objects is made possible.<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  The Quality event is the cause of the subjects and objects, which are then mistakenly presumed to be the cause of the Quality!</p>

<p>Zen is the &ldquo;spirit of the valley,&rdquo; not the mountaintop. <strong>The only Zen you find on the tops of mountains is the Zen you bring up there.</strong> </p>

<p class="important">I think metaphysics is good if it improves everyday life; otherwise forget it.</p>

<p><strong>The past exists only in our memories, the future only in our plans. The present is our only reality.</strong> The tree that you are aware of intellectually, because of that small time lag, is always in the past and therefore is
  always unreal. Any intellectually conceived object is always in the past and therefore unreal. Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place. There is no other reality. This preintellectual reality is
  what Phaedrus felt he had properly identified as Quality. Since all intellectually identifiable things must emerge from this preintellectual reality, Quality is the parent, the source of all subjects and objects.</p>

<p>Romantic Quality was the present, the here and now of things. Classic Quality was always concerned with more than just the present. The relation of the present to the past and future was always considered.</p>

<p>He then proceeded in terms of the trinity to answer the question, Why does everybody see Quality differently? This was the question he had always had to answer speciously before. Now he said, &ldquo;Quality is shapeless, formless,
  indescribable. To see shapes and forms is to intellectualize. Quality is independent of any such shapes and forms. The names, the shapes and forms we give Quality depend only partly on the Quality. They also depend partly on the a priori
  images we have accumulated in our memory. We constantly seek to find, in the Quality event, analogues to our previous experiences. If we didn't we'd be unable to act. We build up our language in terms of these analogues. We build up our
  whole culture in terms of these analogues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not uncommon, he said, for Indian villagers to see ghosts. But they have a terrible time seeing the law of gravity.</p>

<p>This, he said, explains why a classful of freshman composition students arrives at similar ratings of Quality in the compositions. They all have relatively similar backgrounds and similar knowledge. But if a group of foreign students were
  brought in, or, say, medieval poems out of the range of class experience were brought in, then the students' ability to rank Quality would probably not correlate as well.<br />
  People differ about Quality, not because Quality is different, but because people are different in terms of experience. He speculated that if two people had identical a priori analogues they would see Quality identically every time. </p>

<p>&#160;&rdquo;In our highly complex organic state we advanced organisms respond to our environment with an invention of many marvelous analogues. We invent earth and heavens, trees, stones and oceans, gods, music, arts, language,
  philosophy, engineering, civilization and science. We call these analogues reality. And they are reality. We mesmerize our children in the name of truth into knowing that they are reality. We throw anyone who does not accept these analogues
  into an insane asylum. But that which causes us to invent the analogues is Quality. Quality is the continuing stimulus which our environment puts upon us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Every last bit of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#160;It always seemed incredible to me, and still does, I guess, that Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus should have traveled along a line of thought that had never been traveled before. Someone, somewhere, must have thought of all this before, and

<p>It's better not to see than to see wrongly (Poincar&eacute; )</p>

<p>&#160;Poincar&eacute; made it clear that he was not speaking of romantic beauty, the beauty of appearances which strikes the senses. He meant classic beauty, which comes from the harmonious order of the parts, and which a pure intelligence
  can grasp, which gives structure to romantic beauty and without which life would be only vague and fleeting, a dream from which one could not distinguish one's dreams because there would be no basis for making the distinction. It is the
  quest of this special classic beauty, the sense of harmony of the cosmos, which makes us choose the facts most fitting to contribute to this harmony. It is not the facts but the relation of things that results in the universal harmony that
  is the sole objective reality. [related to Leonardo Da Vinci's principles of design (The Vitruvian Man) &amp; <a class="detail-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank">The Golden Ratio</a>; &quot;The Golden
  Ratio describes the most aesthetically pleasing proportionate shapes and designs.&quot;]</p>

<p>Beautiful sunlight on these forests.</p>

<p> I think it's important now to tie care to Quality by pointing out that care and Quality are internal and external aspects of the same thing. A person who sees Quality and feels it as he works is a person who cares. A person who cares
  about what he sees and does is a person who's bound to have some characteristics of Quality.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I think the basic fault that underlies the problem of stuckness is traditional rationality's insistence upon &ldquo;objectivity,&rdquo; a doctrine that there is a divided reality of subject and object. For true science to
  take place these must be rigidly separate from each other. &ldquo;You are the mechanic. There is the motorcycle. You are forever apart from one another. You do this to it. You do that to it. These will be the results.&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This eternally dualistic subject-object way of approaching the motorcycle sounds right to us because we're used to it. But it's not right. It's always been an artificial interpretation superimposed on reality. It's
  never been reality itself. When this duality is completely accepted a certain nondivided relationship between the mechanic and motorcycle, a craftsmanlike feeling for the work, is destroyed. When traditional rationality divides the world
  into subjects and objects it shuts out Quality, and when you're really stuck it's Quality, not any subjects or objects, that tells you where you ought to go.</p>

<p>The leading edge is where absolutely all the action is. The leading edge contains all the infinite possibilities of the future. It contains all the history of the past. Where else could they be contained? <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The past cannot remember the past. The future can't generate the future. The cutting edge of this instant right here and now is always nothing less than the totality of everything there is.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;One's rational understanding of a motorcycle is therefore modified from minute to minute as one works on it and sees that a new and different rational understanding has more Quality. One doesn't cling to old sticky ideas
  because one has an immediate rational basis for rejecting them. Reality isn't static anymore. It's not a set of ideas you have to either fight or resign yourself to. It's made up, in part, of ideas that are expected to grow as you grow, and
  as we all grow, century after century. With Quality as a central undefined term, reality is, in its essential nature, not static but dynamic. And when you really understand dynamic reality you never get stuck. It has forms but the forms are
  capable of change. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To put it in more concrete terms: If you want to build a factory, or fix a motorcycle, or set a nation right without getting stuck, then classical, structured, dualistic subject-object knowledge, although necessary,
  isn't enough. You have to have some feeling for the quality of the work. You have to have a sense of what's good. That is what carries you forward. This sense isn't just something you're born with, although you are born with it. It's also
  something you can develop. It's not just &ldquo;intuition,&rdquo; not just unexplainable &ldquo;skill&rdquo; or &ldquo;talent.&rdquo; It's the direct result of contact with basic reality, Quality, which dualistic reason has in the past
  tended to conceal.</p>

<p>Let's consider a reevaluation of the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the zero of consciousness, isn&#146;t the worst of all possible situations, but the best possible situation you could be in. After all,
  it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to induce; through koans, deep breathing, sitting still and the like. Your mind is empty, you have a &ldquo;hollow-flexible&rdquo; attitude of &ldquo;beginner's
  mind.&rdquo; You're right at the front end of the train of knowledge, at the track of reality itself. Consider, for a change, that this is a moment to be not feared but cultivated. If your mind is truly, profoundly stuck, then you may be
  much better off than when it was loaded with ideas.</p>

<p>But now consider the fact that no matter how hard you try to hang on to it, this stuckness is bound to disappear. Your mind will naturally and freely move toward a solution.</p>

<p>&#160;Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding
  of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.</p>

<p>The solutions all are simple after you have arrived at them. But they're simple only when you know already what they are.</p>

<p>Mass-produced plastics and synthetics aren't in themselves bad. They've just acquired bad associations. A person who's lived inside stone walls of a prison most of his life is likely to see stone as an inherently ugly material, even though
  it's also the prime material of sculpture, and a person who's lived in a prison of ugly plastic technology that started with his childhood toys and continues through a lifetime of junky consumer products is likely to see this material as
  inherently ugly. But the real ugliness of modern technology isn't found in any material or shape or act or product. These are just the objects in which the low Quality appears to reside. It's our habit of assigning Quality to subjects or
  objects that gives this impression.<br />
  The real ugliness is not the result of any objects of technology. Nor is it, if one follows Phaedrus' metaphysics, the result of any subjects of technology, the people who produce it or the people who use it. Quality, or its absence,
  doesn't reside in either the subject or the object. The real ugliness lies in the relationship between the people who produce the technology and the things they produce, which results in a similar relationship between the people who use the
  technology and the things they use.</p>

<p>And it is this identity that modern, dualistically conceived technology lacks. The creator of it feels no particular sense of identity with it. The owner of it feels no particular sense of identity with it. The user of it feels no
  particular sense of identity with it. Hence, by Phaedrus' definition, it has no Quality.</p>

<p>The way to solve the conflict between human values and technological needs is not to run away from technology. That's impossible. The way to resolve the conflict is to break down the barriers of dualistic thought that prevent a real
  understanding of what technology is&#133; not an exploitation of nature, but a fusion of nature and the human spirit into a new kind of creation that transcends both. When this transcendence occurs in such events as the first airplane
  flight across the ocean or the first footstep on the moon, a kind of public recognition of the transcendent nature of technology occurs. But this transcendence should also occur at the individual level, on a personal basis, in one's own
  life, in a less dramatic way.</p>

<p>It can be at a level as simple as sharpening a kitchen knife or sewing a dress or mending a broken chair. The underlying problems are the same. In each case there's a beautiful way of doing it and an ugly way of doing it, and in arriving
  at the high-quality, beautiful way of doing it, both an ability to see what &ldquo;looks good&rdquo; and an ability to understand the underlying methods to arrive at that &ldquo;good&rdquo; are needed. Both classic and romantic
  understandings of Quality must be combined.</p>

<p>The result is rather typical of modern technology, an overall dullness of appearance so depressing that it must be overlaid with a veneer of &quot;style&quot; to make it acceptable. And that, to anyone who is sensitive to romantic Quality,
  just makes it all the worse. Now it's not just depressingly dull, it's also phony. Put the two together and you get a pretty accurate basic description of modern American technology: stylized cars and stylized outboard motors and stylized
  typewriters and stylized clothes. Stylized refrigerators filled with stylized food in stylized kitchens in stylized homes. Plastic stylized toys for stylized children, who at Christmas and birthdays are in style with their stylish parents.
  You have to be awfully stylish yourself not to get sick of it once in a while. It's the style that gets you; technological ugliness syruped over with romantic phoniness in an effort to produce beauty and profit by people who, though
  stylish, don't know where to start because no one has ever told them there's such a thing as Quality in this world and it's real, not style. Quality isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree.
  Real Quality must be the source of the subjects and objects, the cone from which the tree must start.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;This inner peace of mind occurs on three levels of understanding. Physical quietness seems the easiest to achieve, although there are levels and levels of this too, as attested by the ability of Hindu mystics to live
  buried alive for many days. Mental quietness, in which one has no wandering thoughts at all, seems more difficult, but can be achieved. But value quietness, in which one has no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his
  life without desire, that seems the hardest.</p>

<p>&#160;I think that when this concept of peace of mind is introduced and made central to the act of technical work, a fusion of classic and romantic quality can take place at a basic level within a practical working context. I've said you
  can actually see this fusion in skilled mechanics and machinists of a certain sort, and you can see it in the work they do. To say that they are not artists is to misunderstand the nature of art. They have patience, care and attentiveness
  to what they're doing, but more than this - there's a kind of inner peace of mind that isn't contrived but results from a kind of harmony with the work in which there's no leader and no follower. The material and the craftsman's thoughts
  change together in a progression of smooth, even changes until his mind is at rest at the exact instant the material is right. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We've all had moments of that sort when we're doing something we really want to do. It's just that somehow we've gotten into an unfortunate separation of those moments from work. The mechanic I'm talking about
  doesn't make this separation. One says of him that he is &ldquo;interested&rdquo; in what he's doing, that he's &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in his work. What produces this involvement is, at the cutting edge of consciousness, an absence of any
  sense of separateness of subject and object. &ldquo;Being with it,&rdquo; &ldquo;being a natural,&rdquo; &ldquo;taking hold&rdquo; - there are a lot of idiomatic expressions for what I mean by this absence of subject-object duality, because
  what I mean is so well understood as folklore, common sense, the everyday understanding of the shop. But in scientific parlance the words for this absence of subject-object duality are scarce because scientific minds have shut themselves
  off from consciousness of this kind of understanding in the assumption of the formal dualistic scientific outlook.<br />
  &#160;Zen Buddhists talk about &ldquo;just sitting,&rdquo; a meditative practice in which the idea of a duality of self and object does not dominate one's consciousness. What I'm talking about here in motorcycle maintenance is &ldquo;just
  fixing,&rdquo; in which the idea of a duality of self and object doesn't dominate one's consciousness. When one isn't dominated by feelings of separateness from what he's working on, then one can be said to &ldquo;care&rdquo; about what
  he's doing. That is what caring really is, a feeling of identification with what one's doing. When one has this feeling then he also sees the inverse side of caring, Quality itself.</p>

<p>Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.
</p>

<p>&#160;I think that if we are going to reform the world, and make it a better place to live in, the way to do it is not with talk about relationships of a political nature, which are inevitably dualistic, full of subjects and objects and
  their relationship to one another; or with programs full of things for other people to do. I think that kind of approach starts it at the end and presumes the end is the beginning. Programs of a political nature are important end products
  of social quality that can be effective only if the underlying structure of social values is right. The social values are right only if the individual values are right. The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and
  hands, and then work outward from there. </p>

<p>&#160;Sometimes, when thinking about this, I thought that the idea that one person's mind is accessible to another's is just a conversational illusion, just a figure of speech, an assumption that makes some kind of exchange between
  basically alien creatures seem plausible, and that really the relationship of one person to another is ultimately unknowable. The effort of fathoming what is in another's mind creates a distortion of what is seen.</p>

<p>&#160;The gumption-filling process occurs when one is quiet long enough to see and hear and feel the real universe, not just one's own stale opinions about it.</p>

<p>value rigidity that rates rice above freedom (example - the girls who become prostitutes to buy expensive clothes)</p>

<p>&#160;If you have a high evaluation of yourself then your ability to recognize new facts is weakened. Your ego isolates you from the Quality reality. When the facts show that you've just goofed, you're not as likely to admit it. When false
  information makes you look good, you're likely to believe it.</p>

<p>&#160;If modesty doesn't come easily or naturally to you, one way out of this trap is to fake the attitude of modesty anyway. If you just deliberately assume you're not much good, then your gumption gets a boost when the facts prove this
  assumption is correct. This way you can keep going until the time comes when the facts prove this assumption is incorrect.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Impatience is best handled by allowing an indefinite time for the job, particularly new jobs that require unfamiliar techniques; by doubling the allotted time when circumstances force time planning; and by scaling down the
  scope of what you want to do. Overall goals must be scaled down in importance and immediate goals must be scaled up. This requires value flexibility, and the value shift is usually accompanied by some loss of gumption, but it's a sacrifice
  that must be made. It's nothing like the loss of gumption that will occur if a Big Mistake caused by impatience occurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unask the question&rdquo; [mu]</p>

<p> The mu answer is an important one. It's told the scientist that the context of his question is too small for nature's answer and that he must enlarge the context of the question. That is a very important answer! His understanding of
  nature is tremendously improved by it, which was the purpose of the experiment in the first place. A very strong case can be made for the statement that science grows by its mu answers more than by its yes or no answer. Yes or no confirms
  or denies a hypothesis. Mu says the answer is beyond the hypothesis. Mu is the &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; that inspires scientific enquiry in the first place! </p>

<p>You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally. That's the way all the experts do it. The making of a painting or the fixing of a motorcycle isn't separate from the rest of
  your existence. </p>

<p>The real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be &ldquo;out there&rdquo; and the person that appears to be &ldquo;in here&rdquo; are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away
  from Quality together.</p>

<p>&#160;&rdquo;There are worse things than hiding in the shadows. Is that it? Is that why you don't speak? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Don't throw anything away. Never, never throw anything away.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;The metal of these wrenches is so cold it hurts the hands. But it's a good hurt. It's real, not imaginary, and it's here, absolutely, in my hand.</p>

<p>...apparent ability to converse intelligently.</p>

<p>The entire description of the committee's work was a strange pattern of ordinary enough words put together in a most unordinary way, so that the explanation seemed far more complex than the thing he was trying to have explained.</p>

<p>And yet here was one of the most ambiguous, inscrutable styles Phaedrus had ever read. Here were encyclopedic sentences that left subject and predicate completely out of shouting distance. Parenthetic elements were unexplainably inserted
  inside other parenthetic elements, equally unexplainably inserted into sentences whose relevance to the preceding sentences in the reader's mind was dead and buried and decayed long before the arrival of the period.<br />
  But most remarkable of all were the wondrous and unexplained proliferations of abstract categories that seemed freighted [&#1085;&#1072;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;] with special meanings that never got stated
  and whose content could only be guessed at; these piled one after another so fast and so close that Phaedrus knew he had no possible way of understanding what was before him, much less take issue with it.</p>

<p>His second hypothesis was that the Chairman was a &ldquo;technician,&rdquo; a phrase he used for a writer so deeply involved in his field that he&#146;d lost the ability to communicate with people outside.</p>

<p>The Chairman&#146;s statements were guarded by enormous, labyrinthine fortifications that went on and on with such complexity and massiveness it was almost impossible to discover what in the world it was inside them he was guarding. The
  inscrutability of all this was the kind of inscrutability you have when you suddenly enter a room where a furious argument has just ended. Everyone is quiet. No one is talking.</p>

<p>You point to something as having Quality and the Quality tends to go away. Quality is what you see out of the corner of your eye...</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;I think he must have felt at the time that what he was saying was true and it didn't matter if his manner or presentation was outrageous or not. There was so much to it he didn't have time for prettying it up. If the University
  of Chicago was interested in the esthetics of what he was saying rather than the rational content, they were failing their fundamental purpose as a University.</p>

<p>Dualistic excellence is achieved by objectivity, but creative excellence is not.</p>

<p><a class="detail-link" href="http://journeytothesea.com/mythos-logos/" target="_blank">&ldquo;mythos over logos&rdquo;</a> argument</p>

<p>&#160;The term logos, the root word of &ldquo;logic,&rdquo; refers to the sum total of our rational understanding of the world. Mythos is the sum total of the early historic and prehistoric myths which preceded the logos. The mythos
  includes not only the Greek myths but the Old Testament, the Vedic Hymns and the early legends of all cultures which have contributed to our present world understanding. The mythos-over-logos argument states that our rationality is shaped
  by these legends, that our knowledge today is in relation to these legends as a tree is in relation to the little shrub it once was. One can gain great insights into the complex overall structure of the tree by studying the much simpler
  shape of the shrub. There's no difference in kind or even difference in identity, only a difference in size.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, in cultures whose ancestry includes ancient Greece, one invariably finds a strong subject-object differentiation because the grammar of the old Greek mythos presumed a sharp natural division of subjects and
  predicates. In cultures such as the Chinese, where subject-predicate relationships are not rigidly defined by grammar, one finds a corresponding absence of rigid subject-object philosophy. One finds that in the Judeo-Christian culture in
  which the Old Testament &ldquo;Word&rdquo; had an intrinsic sacredness of its own, men are willing to sacrifice and live by and die for words. In this culture, a court of law can ask a witness to tell &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and
  nothing but the truth, so help me God,&rdquo; and expect the truth to be told. But one can transport this court to India, as did the British, with no real success on the matter of perjury because the Indian mythos is different and this
  sacredness of words is not felt in the same way. Similar problems have occurred in this country among minority groups with different cultural backgrounds. There are endless examples of how mythos differences direct behavior differences and
  they're all fascinating.</p>

<p>There is only one kind of person, Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus said, who accepts or rejects the mythos in which he lives. And the definition of that person, when he has rejected the mythos, Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus said, is &ldquo;insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because Quality is the generator of the mythos. That's it. That's what he meant when he said, &ldquo;Quality is the continuing stimulus which causes us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Every last bit of it.&rdquo; Religion
  isn't invented by man. Men are invented by religion. </p>

<p>So your definition is made up of what you know. It's an analogue to what you already know. It has to be. It can't be anything else. And the mythos grows this way. By analogies to what is known before. The mythos is a building of analogues
  upon analogues upon analogues. These fill the collective consciousness of all communicating mankind. Every last bit of it. The Quality is the track that directs the train. What is outside the train, to either side - that is the terra
  incognita of the insane. He knew that to understand Quality he would have to leave the mythos. </p>

<p class="important">How can I love all this so much and be insane?</p>

<p>&#160;The mythos. The mythos is insane. That's what he believed. The mythos that says the forms of this world are real but the Quality of this world is unreal, that is insane!<br />
  And in Aristotle and the ancient Greeks he believed he had found the villains who had so shaped the mythos as to cause us to accept this insanity as reality.</p>

<p class="important">Bouncing on beds, I remember from childhood, is a great depression reliever.</p>

<p>It's paradoxical that where people are the most closely crowded, in the big coastal cities in the East and West, the loneliness is the greatest. Back where people were so spread out in western Oregon and Idaho and Montana and the Dakotas
  you'd think the loneliness would have been greater, but we didn't see it so much.<br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The explanation, I suppose, is that the physical distance between people has nothing to do with loneliness. It's psychic distance, and in Montana and Idaho the physical distances are big but the psychic distances
  between people are small, and here it's reversed.<br />
  There's this primary America of freeways and jet flights and TV and movie spectaculars. And people caught up in this primary America seem to go through huge portions of their lives without much consciousness of what's immediately around
  them. The media have convinced them that what's right around them is unimportant. And that's why they're lonely. You see it in their faces. First the little flicker of searching, and then when they look at you, you're just a kind of an
  object. You don't count. You're not what they're looking for. You're not on TV.<br />
  But in the secondary America we've been through, of back roads, and Chainman's ditches, and Appaloosa horses, and sweeping mountain ranges, and meditative thoughts, and kids with pinecones and bumblebees and open sky above us mile after
  mile after mile, all through that, what was real, what was around us dominated. And so there wasn't much feeling of loneliness. That's the way it must have been a hundred or two hundred years ago. Hardly any people and hardly any
  loneliness. <br />
  &#160;Technology is blamed for a lot of this loneliness, since the loneliness is certainly associated with the newer technological devices - TV, jets, freeways and so on - but I hope it's been made plain that the real evil isn't the objects
  of technology but the tendency of technology to isolate people into lonely attitudes of objectivity. It's the objectivity, the dualistic way of looking at things underlying technology, that produces the evil. That's why I went to so much
  trouble to show how technology could be used to destroy the evil. A person who knows how to fix motorcycles - with Quality - is less likely to run short of friends than one who doesn't. And they aren't going to see him as some kind of
  object either. Quality destroys objectivity every time.<br />
  &#160;&#160;Or if he takes whatever dull job he's stuck with - and they are all, sooner or later, dull - and, just to keep himself amused, starts to look for options of Quality, and secretly pursues these options, just for their own sake,
  thus making an art out of what he is doing, he's likely to discover that he becomes a much more interesting person and much less of an object to the people around him because his Quality decisions change him too. And not only the job and
  him, but others too because the Quality tends to fan out like waves. The Quality job he didn't think anyone was going to see is seen, and the person who sees it feels a little better because of it, and is likely to pass that feeling on to
  others, and in that way the Quality tends to keep on going.<br />
  My personal feeling is that this is how any further improvement of the world will be done: by individuals making Quality decisions and that's all. God, I don't want to have any more enthusiasm for big programs full of social planning for
  big masses of people that leave individual Quality out. These can be left alone for a while. There's a place for them but they've got to be built on a foundation of Quality within the individuals involved. We've had that individual Quality
  in the past, exploited it as a natural resource without knowing it, and now it's just about depleted. <br />
  We do need a return to individual integrity, self-reliance and old-fashioned gumption. We really do. </p>

<p>I'm sure if I knew a lot more about it I would see a lot more and not find it primitive at all. </p>

<p>The reason why, if he were not more than two thousand years dead, he would have gladly rubbed him out is that he saw him as a prototype for the many millions of self-satisfied and truly ignorant teachers throughout history who have smugly
  and callously killed the creative spirit of their students with this dumb ritual of analysis, this blind, rote, eternal naming of things. Walk into any of a hundred thousand classrooms today and hear the teachers divide and subdivide and
  interrelate and establish &ldquo;principles&rdquo; and study &ldquo;methods&rdquo; and what you will hear is the ghost of Aristotle speaking down through the centuries - the desiccating lifeless voice of dualistic reason.</p>

<p>The next week Phaedrus had read the material and was prepared to take apart the statement that rhetoric is an art because it can be reduced to a rational system of order. By this criterion General Motors produced pure art, whereas Picasso
  did not.</p>

<p>The innocent student stares down at the table, face red, hands shrouding his eyes. His shame becomes Phaedrus' anger. In all his classes he never once talked to a student like that. So that's how they teach classics at the University of
  Chicago. Phaedrus knows the Professor of Philosophy now. But the Professor of Philosophy doesn't know Phaedrus.</p>

<p>Phaedrus studied hard during this period, and learned extremely fast, and kept his mouth shut, but it would be wrong to give the least impression that he was any sort of good student. A good student seeks knowledge fairly and impartially.
  Phaedrus did not. He had an axe to grind and all he sought were those things that helped him grind it, and the means of knocking down anything which prevented him from grinding it. He had no time for or interest in other people's Great
  Books. He was there solely to write a Great Book of his own. His attitude toward Aristotle was grossly unfair for the same reason Aristotle was unfair to his predecessors. They fouled up what he wanted to say.</p>

<p>Dialectic generally means &ldquo;of the nature of the dialogue,&rdquo; which is a conversation between two persons. Nowadays it means logical argumentation. It involves a technique of cross-examination, by which truth is arrived at. It's
  the mode of discourse of Socrates in the Dialogues of Plato. Plato believed the dialectic was the sole method by which the truth was arrived at. The only one. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That's why it's a fulcrum word. Aristotle attacked this belief, saying that the dialectic was only suitable for some purposes - to enquire into men's beliefs, to arrive at truths about eternal forms of things, known
  as Ideas, which were fixed and unchanging and constituted reality for Plato. Aristotle said there is also the method of science, or &ldquo;physical&rdquo; method, which observes physical facts and arrives at truths about substances, which
  undergo change. This duality of form and substance and the scientific method of arriving at facts about substances were central to Aristotle's philosophy. Thus the dethronement of dialectic from what Socrates and Plato held it to be was
  absolutely essential for Aristotle, and &ldquo;dialectic&rdquo; was and still is a fulcrum word.</p>

<p>Phaedrus is silent and tries to work out an answer. Everyone is waiting. His thoughts move up to lightning speed, winnowing through the dialectic, playing one argumentative chess opening after another, seeing that each one loses, and
  moving to the next one, faster and faster - but all the class witnesses is silence. </p>

<p>Phaedrus' mind races on and on and then on further, seeing now at last a kind of evil thing, an evil deeply entrenched in himself, which pretends to try to understand love and beauty and truth and wisdom but whose real purpose is never to
  understand them, whose real purpose is always to usurp them and enthrone itself.</p>

<p>Phaedrus reads further and further into pre-Socratic Greek thought to find out, and eventually comes to the view that Plato's hatred of the rhetoricians was part of a much larger struggle in which the reality of the Good, represented by
  the Sophists, and the reality of the True, represented by the dialecticians, were engaged in a huge struggle for the future mind of man. Truth won, the Good lost, and that is why today we have so little difficulty accepting the reality of
  truth and so much difficulty accepting the reality of Quality, even though there is no more agreement in one area than in the other.</p>

<p>But the mythos goes on, and that which destroys the old mythos becomes the new mythos&#8230;<br />
  (p. 316-317- interesting!)</p>

<p>&#160;The results of Socrates&#146; martyrdom and Plato's unexcelled prose that followed are nothing less than the whole world of Western man as we know it. If the idea of truth had been allowed to perish unrediscovered by the Renaissance
  it's unlikely that we would be much beyond the level of prehistoric man today. The ideas of science and technology and other systematically organized efforts of man are dead-centered on it. It is the nucleus of it all. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, Phaedrus understands, what he is saying about Quality is somehow opposed to all this. It seems to agree much more closely with the Sophists. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Man is the measure of all things.&rdquo; Yes, that's what he is saying about Quality. Man is not the source of all things, as the subjective idealists would say. Nor is he the passive observer of all things,
  as the objective idealists and materialists would say. The Quality which creates the world emerges as a relationship between man and his experience. He is a participant in the creation of all things. The measure of all things - it
  fits.<br />
  The one thing that doesn't fit what he says and what Plato said about the Sophists is their profession of teaching virtue. All accounts indicate this was absolutely central to their teaching, but how are you going to teach virtue if you
  teach the relativity of all ethical ideas? Virtue, if it implies anything at all, implies an ethical absolute. A person whose idea of what is proper varies from day to day can be admired for his broadmindedness, but not for his virtue. Not,
  at least, as Phaedrus understands the word.</p>

<p>&rdquo;What moves the Greek warrior to deeds of heroism,&rdquo; Kitto comments, &ldquo;is not a sense of duty as we understand it - duty towards others: it is rather duty towards himself. He strives after that which we translate 'virtue'
  but is in Greek aret&eacute;, 'excellence' - we shall have much to say about aret&eacute;. It runs through Greek life.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Phaedrus is fascinated too by the description of the motive of &ldquo;duty toward self &rdquo; which is an almost exact translation of the Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes described as the &ldquo;one&rdquo; of the Hindus. Can the dharma of
  the Hindus and the &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; of the ancient Greeks be identical?</p>

<p>Quality! Virtue! Dharma! That is what the Sophists were teaching! Not ethical relativism. Not pristine &ldquo;virtue.&rdquo; But aret&eacute;. Excellence. Dharma! Before the Church of Reason. Before substance. Before form. Before mind and
  matter. Before dialectic itself. Quality had been absolute. Those first teachers of the Western world were teaching Quality, and the medium they had chosen was that of rhetoric. </p>

<p>Thus the hero of the Odyssey is a great fighter, a wily schemer, a ready speaker, a man of stout heart and broad wisdom who knows that he must endure without too much complaining what the gods send; and he can both build and sail a boat,
  drive a furrow as straight as anyone, beat a young braggart at throwing the discus, challenge the Pheacian youth at boxing, wrestling or running; flay, skin, cut up and cook an ox, and be moved to tears by a song. He is in fact an excellent
  all-rounder; he has surpassing [&#1085;&#1077;&#1085;&#1072;&#1076;&#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;&#1090;] aret&eacute;.<br />
<p class="important">Aret&eacute; implies a respect for the wholeness or oneness of life, and a consequent dislike of specialization. It implies a contempt for efficiency - or rather a much higher idea of efficiency, an efficiency which
  exists not in one department of life but in life itself.</p>
<p>Phaedrus remembered a line from Thoreau: &ldquo;You never gain something but that you lose something.&rdquo; And now he began to see for the first time the unbelievable magnitude of what man, when he gained power to understand and rule the
  world in terms of dialectic truths, had lost. He had built empires of scientific capability to manipulate the phenomena of nature into enormous manifestations of his own dreams of power and wealth - but for this he had exchanged an empire
  of understanding of equal magnitude: an understanding of what it is to be a part of the world, and not an enemy of it.</p>

<p>&#160;The halo around the heads of Plato and Socrates is now gone. He sees that they consistently are doing exactly that which they accuse the Sophists of doing - using emotionally persuasive language for the ulterior purpose of making the
  weaker argument, the case for dialectic, appear the stronger. We always condemn most in others, he thought, that which we most fear in ourselves.</p>

<p>Plato hadn't tried to destroy aret&eacute;. He had encapsulated it; made a permanent, fixed Idea out of it; had converted it to a rigid, immobile Immortal Truth. He made aret&eacute; the Good, the highest form, the highest Idea of all. It
  was subordinate only to Truth itself, in a synthesis of all that had gone before. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was why the Quality that Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus had arrived at in the classroom had seemed so close to Plato's Good. Plato's Good was taken from the rhetoricians. Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus searched, but could find no
  previous cosmologists who had talked about the Good. That was from the Sophists. The difference was that Plato's Good was a fixed and eternal and unmoving Idea, whereas for the rhetoricians it was not an Idea at all. The Good was not a form
  of reality. It was reality itself, ever changing, ultimately unknowable in any kind of fixed, rigid way.<br />

<p>Year after year, decade after decade of little front-row &ldquo;readers,&rdquo; mimics with pretty smiles and neat pens, out to get their Aristotelian A's while those who possess the real aret&eacute; sit silently in back of them wondering
  what is wrong with themselves that they cannot like this subject.</p>

<p>When a shepherd goes to kill a wolf, and takes his dog to see the sport, he should take care to avoid mistakes. The dog has certain relationships to the wolf the shepherd may have forgotten.</p>

<p>He shouldn't have cut it off, Phaedrus thinks to himself. Were he a real Truth-seeker and not a propagandist for a particular point of view he would not. He might learn something. Once it's stated that &ldquo;the dialectic comes before
  anything else,&rdquo; this statement itself becomes a dialectical entity, subject to dialectical question.<br />
  &#160;&#160;Phaedrus would have asked, What evidence do we have that the dialectical question-and-answer method of arriving at truth comes before anything else? We have none whatsoever. And when the statement is isolated and itself subject
  to scrutiny it becomes patently ridiculous. Here is this dialectic, like Newton's law of gravity, just sitting by itself in the middle of nowhere, giving birth to the universe, hey? It's asinine.<br />
  &#160;&#160;Dialectic, which is the parent of logic, came itself from rhetoric. Rhetoric is in turn the child of the myths and poetry of ancient Greece. That is so historically, and that is so by any application of common sense. The poetry
  and the myths are the response of a prehistoric people to the universe around them made on the basis of Quality. It is Quality, not dialectic, which is the generator of everything we know.</p>

<p>A lifetime of blows tends to make a person unenthusiastic about any unnecessary interchange that might lead to more. Nothing friendly has been said or even hinted at and much hostility has been shown.</p>

<p>The Church of Reason, like all institutions of the System, is based not on individual strength but upon individual weakness. What's really demanded in the Church of Reason is not ability, but inability. Then you are considered teachable. A
  truly able person is always a threat. Phaedrus sees that he has thrown away a chance to integrate himself into the organization by submitting to whatever Aristotelian thing he is supposed to submit to. But that kind of opportunity seems
  hardly worth the bowing and scraping and intellectual prostration [&#1091;&#1085;&#1080;&#1078;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;] necessary to maintain it. It is a low-quality form of life.</p>

<p> Quality for sheep is what the shepherd says. And if you take a sheep and put it up at the timberline at night when the wind is roaring, that sheep will be panicked half to death and will call and call until the shepherd comes, or comes
  the wolf.</p>

<p>As the class goes on Ph&#1072;&#1077;drus sits staring out the window feeling sorry for this old shepherd and his classroom sheep and dogs and sorry for himself that he will never be one of them.</p>

<p>The city closes in on him now, and in his strange perspective it becomes the antithesis of what he believes. The citadel not of Quality, the citadel of form and substance. Substance in the form of steel sheets and girders, substance in the
  form of concrete piers and roads, in the form of brick, of asphalt, of auto parts, old radios, and rails, dead carcasses of animals that once grazed the prairies. Form and substance without Quality. That is the soul of this place. Blind,
  huge, sinister and inhuman: seen by the light of fire flaring upward in the night from the blast furnaces in the south, through heavy coal smoke deeper and denser into the neon of BEER and PIZZA and LAUNDROMAT signs and unknown and
  meaningless signs along meaningless straight streets going off into other straight streets forever. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it was all bricks and concrete, pure forms of substance, clearly and openly, he might survive. It is the little, pathetic attempts at Quality that kill. The plaster false fireplace in the apartment, shaped and
  waiting to contain a flame that can never exist. Or the hedge in front of the apartment building with a few square feet of grass behind it. A few square feet of grass, after Montana. If they just left out the hedge and grass it would be all
  right. Now it serves only to draw attention to what has been lost. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Along the streets that lead away from the apartment he can never see anything through the concrete and brick and neon but he knows that buried within it are grotesque, twisted souls forever trying the manners that
  will convince themselves they possess Quality, learning strange poses of style and glamour vended by dream magazines and other mass media, and paid for by the vendors of substance. He thinks of them at night alone with their advertised
  glamorous shoes and stockings and underclothes off, staring through the sooty windows at the grotesque shells revealed beyond them, when the poses weaken and the truth creeps in, the only truth that exists here, crying to heaven, God, there
  is nothing here but dead neon and cement and brick.</p>

<p>Not only are his thoughts slowing down, but his desires too. And they slow and slow, as if gaining an imponderable [&#1085;&#1077;&#1080;&#1079;&#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1080;&#1084;&#1072;] mass. So heavy, so tired, but no sleep comes. He
  feels like a giant, a million miles tall. He feels himself extending into the universe with no limit.</p>

<p>I can imitate the father he's supposed to have, but subconsciously, at the Quality level, he sees through it and knows his real father isn't here. In all this Chautauqua talk there's been more than a touch of hypocrisy. Advice is given
  again and again to eliminate subject-object duality, when the biggest duality of all, the duality between me and him, remains unfaced. A mind divided against itself.</p>

<p>&#160;I survive mainly by pleasing others. You do that to get out. To get out you figure out what they want you to say and then you say it with as much skill and originality as possible and then, if they're convinced, you get out. </p>

<p>Coastal people never really know what the ocean symbolizes to landlocked inland people - what a great distant dream it is, present but unseen in the deepest levels of subconsciousness, and when they arrive at the ocean and the conscious
  images are compared with the subconscious dream there is a sense of defeat at having come so far to be so stopped by a mystery that can never be fathomed. The source of it all.</p>

<p>A long time later we come to a town where a luminous haze which has seemed so natural over the ocean is now seen in the streets of the town, giving them a certain aura, a hazy sunny radiance that makes everything look nostalgic, as if
  remembered from years before.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160; &#160;&rdquo;It is hard?&rdquo; <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&rdquo;Not if you have the right attitudes. It's having the right attitudes that's hard.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Trials never end, of course. Unhappiness and misfortune are bound to occur as long as people live, but there is a feeling now, that was not here before, and is not just on the surface of things, but penetrates all the way through: We've
  won it. It's going to get better now. You can sort of tell these things.</p>

<p>This book has a lot to say about Ancient Greek perspectives and their meaning but there is one perspective it misses. That is their view of time. They saw the future as something that came upon them from behind their backs with the past
  receding away before their eyes. <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When you think about it, that's a more accurate metaphor than our present one. Who really can face the future? All you can do is project from the past, even when the past shows that such projections are often wrong.
  And who really can forget the past? What else is there to know? <br />
  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ten years after the publication of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance the Ancient Greek perspective is certainly appropriate. What sort of future is coming up from behind I don't really know. But the past,
  spread out ahead, dominates everything in sight.<br />
