<h3>I Will, I Won't, I Want: What Willpower Is, and Why It Matters</h3>

<p>People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are better off almost any way you look at it. They are happier and healthier. Their relationships are more satisfying and last longer. They make more money and go
  further in their careers. They are better able to manage stress, deal with conflict and overcome adversity. They even live longer.</p>
<p>
  Self-control is a better predictor of academic success than intelligence (take that, SATs), a stronger determinant of effective leadership than charisma, and more important for marital bliss than empathy (yes, the secret to lasting marriage
  may be learning how to keep your mouth shut).</p>
<p>
  If a basic human brain is pretty good at self-control, is there anything we can do right now to improve on the standard model?<br />
  ...the brain is remarkably responsive to experience. Ask your brain to do maths every day, and it gets better at maths. Ask your brain to worry, and it gets better at worrying. Ask your brain to concentrate, and it gets better at
  concentrating.</p>
<p>
  ...<b>meditate</b>. Neuroscientists have discovered that when you ask the brain to meditate, it gets better not just at meditating, but also at a wide range of self-control skills, including attention, focus, stress management, impulse
  control and self-awareness. People who meditate regularly aren't just better at these things. Over time, their brains become finely tuned willpower machines. Regular meditators have more grey matter in the prefrontal cortex, as well as
  regions of the brain that support self-awareness.</p>
<p>
  Not only does your brain find these things easier, but it actually remodels itself based on what you ask it to do. Some parts of the brain grow denser, packing in more and more grey matter like a muscle bulking up from exercise. ... Areas
  of the brain can also grow more connected to each other, so they can share information more quickly.</p>
<p>
  One study found that just three hours of meditation practice led to improved attention and self-control. After eleven hours, researchers could see those changes in the brain. The new meditators had increased neural connections between
  regions of the brain important for staying focused, ignoring distractions and controlling impulses. Another study found that eight weeks of daily meditation practice led to increased self-awareness in everyday life, as well as increased
  grey matter in corresponding areas of the brain.</p>
<p>
  It may seem incredible that our brains can reshape themselves so quickly, but meditation increases blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, in much the same way that lifting weights increases blood flow to your muscles. The brain appears to
  adapt to exercise in the same way that muscles do, getting both bigger and faster in order to get better at what you ask of it.</p>

  <h3>A FIVE-MINUTE BRAIN-TRAINING MEDITATION</h3>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>Sit still and stay put.
      <p>Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the ground, or sit cross-legged on a cushion. Sit up straight and rest your hands in your lap. It's important not to fidget when you meditate - that's the physical foundation of self-control. If
        you notice the instinct to scratch an itch, adjust your arms, or cross and uncross your legs; see if you can feel the urge but not follow it. This simple act of staying still is part of what makes meditation willpower training
        effective. You're learning not to automatically follow every single impulse that your brain and body produce.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Turn your attention to the breath.
      <p>Close your eyes or, if you are worried about falling asleep, focus your gaze at a single spot (such as a blank wall, not the television screen). Begin to notice your breathing. Silently say in your mind <q>inhale</q> as you breathe
        in and <q>exhale</q> as you breathe out. When you notice your mind wandering (and it will), just bring it back to the breath. This practice of coming back to the breath, again and again, kicks the prefrontal cortex into high gear and
        quiets the stress and craving centres of your brain.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Notice how it feels to breathe, and notice how the mind wanders.
      <p>After a few minutes, drop the labels <q>inhale/exhale.</q> Try focusing on just the feeling of breathing. You might notice the sensations of the breath flowing in and out of your nose and mouth. You might sense the belly or chest
        expanding as you breathe in, and deflating as you breathe out. Your mind might wander a bit more without the labelling. Just as before, when you notice yourself thinking about something else, bring your attention back to the breath.
        If you need help refocusing, bring yourself back to the breath by saying <q>inhale</q> and <q>exhale</q> for a few rounds. This part of the practice trains self-awareness along with self-control.</p>
      <p>
        Start with five minutes a day. When this becomes a habit, try ten to fifteen minutes a day.
        A short practice that you do every day is better than a long practice you keep putting off to tomorrow. It may help you to pick a specific time that you will meditate every day, like right before your morning shower.</p>
    </li>

<h3>The Willpower Instinct: Your Body Was Born to Resist Cake</h3>

<p>But unlike the sabre-toothed tiger, the tart is not the real threat. Think about it: that tart cannot do anything to you, your health, or your waistline unless you take a bite of it. That's right: this time, the enemy is within.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHAT IS THE THREAT?</h3>

<p>We're used to seeing temptation and trouble outside of ourselves: the dangerous doughnut, the sinful cigarette, the enticing Internet. But self-control points the mirror back at ourselves, and our inner worlds of thoughts, desires,
  emotions and impulses. For your willpower challenge, identify the inner impulse that needs to be restrained. What is the thought or feeling that makes you want to do whatever it is you don't want to do? If you aren't sure, try some field
  observation. Next time you're tempted, turn your attention inward.</p>

<p>You'll recall from our trip to the Serengeti that a fight-or-flight stress response starts when you recognize an external threat. Your brain and body go into the self-defence mode of attack or escape. The pause-and-plan response differs in
  one very crucial way: it starts with the perception of an internal conflict, not an external threat. You want to do one thing (smoke a cigarette, eat more at lunch, visit inappropriate websites at work), but know you shouldn't. Or you know
  you should do something (submit your tax return, finish a project, go to the gym), but you'd rather do nothing. This internal conflict is its own kind of threat: your instincts are pushing you toward a potentially bad decision. What's
  needed, therefore, is protection of yourself by yourself. This is what self-control is all about. The most helpful response will be to slow you down, not speed you up (as a fight-or-flight response does). And this is precisely what the
  pause-and-plan response does. The perception of an internal conflict triggers changes in the brain and body that help you slow down and control your impulses.</p>

<p>One important job of this system is to keep you from making stupid mistakes, like breaking a six-month stretch of sobriety, shouting at your boss or ignoring your overdue credit card bills. The self-monitoring system is just waiting to
  detect warning signs - in the form of thoughts, emotions and sensations - that you are about to do something you will later regret. When your brain recognizes such a warning, our good friend the prefrontal cortex jumps into action to help
  you make the right choice. To help the prefrontal cortex, the pause-and-plan response redirects energy from the body to the brain. For self-control, you don't need legs ready to run or arms ready to punch, but a well-fuelled brain ready to
  flex its power.</p>

<p><b>Heart rate variability</b> is such a good index of willpower that you can use it to predict who will resist temptation, and who will give in. For example, recovering alcoholics whose heart rate variability goes up when they see a drink
  are more likely to stay sober. Recovering alcoholics who show the opposite response - their heart rate variability drops when they see a drink - have a greater risk of relapse. Studies also show that people with higher heart rate
  variability are better at ignoring distractions, delaying gratification and dealing with stressful situations. They are also less likely to give up on difficult tasks, even when they initially fail or receive critical feedback. These
  findings have led psychologists to call heart rate variability the body's <q>reserve</q> of willpower - a physiological measure of your capacity for self-control. If you have high heart rate variability, you have more willpower available
  for whenever temptation strikes.</p>

<p>Anything that puts a stress on your mind or body can interfere with the physiology of self-control, and by extension, sabotage your willpower. Anxiety, anger, depression and loneliness are all associated with lower heart rate variability
  and less self-control. Chronic pain and illness can also drain your body and brain's willpower reserve. But there are just as many things you can do that shift the body and mind toward the physiology of self-control. The focus meditation
  you learned in the last chapter is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve the biological basis of willpower. It not only trains the brain, but also increases heart rate variability. Anything else that you do to reduce stress
  and take care of your health - exercise, get a good night's sleep, eat better, spend quality time with friends and family, participate in a religious or spiritual practice - will improve your body's willpower reserve.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: BREATHE YOUR WAY TO SELF-CONTROL</h3>

<p>You won't find many quick fixes in this book, but there is one way to immediately boost willpower: slow your breathing down to four to six breaths per minute. That's ten to fifteen seconds per breath - slower than you normally breathe, but
  not difficult with a little bit of practice and patience. Slowing the breath down activates the prefrontal cortex and increases heart rate variability, which helps shift the brain and body from a state of stress to self-control mode. A few
  minutes of this technique will make you feel calm, in control, and capable of handling cravings or challenges.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to practise slowing down your breath before you're staring at a chocolate cake. Start by timing yourself to see how many breaths you normally take in one minute. Then begin to slow the breath down without holding your
  breath (that will only increase stress). For most people, it's easier to slow down the exhalation, so focus on exhaling slowly and completely (pursing your lips and imagining that you are exhaling through a straw in your mouth can help).
  Exhaling fully will help you breathe in more fully and deeply without struggling. If you don't quite get down to four breaths a minute, don't worry. Heart rate variability steadily increases as your breathing rate drops below twelve per
  minute.</p>
<p>Research shows that regular practice of this technique can make you more resilient to stress and build your willpower reserve.</p>

<p>The trial's guinea pigs were six men and eighteen women, ranging in age from eighteen to fifty years old. After two months of the treatment, they showed improvements in attention and the ability to ignore distractions. In an age of
  thirty-second attention spans, that would have been reason enough to celebrate. But there was more. They had reduced their smoking, drinking and caffeine intake - despite the fact that nobody had asked them to. They were eating less junk
  food and more healthy food. They were spending less time watching television and more time studying. They were saving money and spending less on impulse purchases. They felt more in control of their emotions. They even procrastinated less
  and were less likely to be late for appointments.
  The willpower miracle was <b>physical exercise</b>.</p>

<p>The long-term effects of exercise are even more impressive. It not only relieves ordinary, everyday stress, but it's as powerful an antidepressant as Prozac. </p>

<p>When neuroscientists have peered inside the brains of new exercisers, they have seen increases in both grey matter - brain cells - and white matter, the insulation on brain cells that helps them communicate quickly and efficiently with
  each other. <em>Physical exercise - like meditation - makes your brain bigger and faster</em>, and the prefrontal cortex shows the largest training effect.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: THE FIVE-MINUTE GREEN WILLPOWER BOOST</h3>

  <p>If you want a quick willpower boost, your best bet may be to head outdoors. Just five minutes of what scientists call <q>green exercise</q> decreases stress, improves mood, enhances focus and boosts self-control. Green exercise is any
    physical activity that gets you outdoors and in the presence of Mother Nature. The best news is that when it comes to green exercise, a quick fix really is enough. Shorter bursts have a more powerful effect on your mood than longer
    workouts. You also don't have to break a sweat or push yourself to exhaustion. <em>Lower-intensity exercise, like walking, has stronger immediate effects than high-intensity exercise.</em> Here are some ideas for your own five-minute
    green exercise willpower boost:</p>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li>Get out of the office and head for the closest greenery.</li>
    <li>Line up a favourite song on your iPod and walk or jog around the block.</li>
    <li>Take your dog outside to play (and chase the toy yourself ).</li>
    <li>Do a bit of work in your garden.</li>
    <li>Step outside for some fresh air and do a few simple stretches.</li>
    <li>Challenge your kids to a race or game in the garden.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><i>If you tell yourself that you are too tired or don't have the time to exercise, start thinking of exercise as something that restores, not drains, your energy and willpower.</i></p>

<p><em>If you are surviving on less than six hours of sleep a night, there's a good chance you don't even remember what it's like to have your full willpower.</em> Being mildly but chronically sleep deprived makes you more susceptible to
  stress, cravings and temptation.</p>

<p>Studies show that the effects of sleep deprivation on your brain are equivalent to being mildly intoxicated - a state that many of us can attest does little for self-control.</p>

<p>In one study, five minutes of breath-focus meditation a day helped recovering addicts fall asleep. This added one hour a night to their quality sleep time, which in turn significantly reduced the risk of drug use relapse.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: ZZZZZZZZZZ</h3>

<p>If you've been running short on sleep, there are many ways to recharge your self-control. Even if you can't get eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night, small changes can make a big difference. Some studies show that a single good
  night's sleep restores brain function to an optimal level. So if you've had a week of late to bed and early to rise, catching up at the weekend can help replenish your willpower. Other research suggests that getting enough sleep early in
  the week can build a reserve that counteracts sleep deprivation later in the week. And some studies suggest that it's the number of consecutive hours you spend awake that matters most. In a crunch, taking a short nap can restore focus and
  self-control even if you didn't get much sleep the night before. Try one of these strategies - catching up, stocking up or napping - to undo or prevent the effects of sleep deprivation.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: RELAX TO RESTORE YOUR WILLPOWER RESERVE</h3>

<p>We're not talking about mindlessly watching television or <q>relaxing</q> with a glass of wine and a huge meal. The kind of relaxation that boosts willpower is true physical and mental rest that triggers what Harvard Medical School
  cardiologist Herbert Benson calls the physiological relaxation response. Your heart rate and breathing slow down, your blood pressure drops and your muscles release held tension. Your brain takes a break from planning the future or
  analyzing the past.</p>
<p>To trigger this relaxation response, lie down on your back, and slightly elevate your legs with a pillow under the knees (or come into whatever is the most comfortable position for you to rest in). Close your eyes and take a few deep
  breaths, allowing your belly to rise and fall. If you feel any tension in your body, you can intentionally squeeze or contract that muscle, then let go of the effort. For example, if you notice tension in your hands and fingers, squeeze
  your hands into fists, then relax them into open hands. If you notice tension in your forehead or jaw, scrunch up your eyes and face, then stretch your mouth wide open before relaxing the face completely. Stay here for five to ten minutes,
  enjoying the fact that there is nothing to do but breathe. If you're worried about falling asleep, set an alarm.</p>
<p>Make this a daily practice, especially when you're dealing with high levels of stress or willpower demands. Relaxation will help your body recover from the physiological effects of chronic stress or heroic self-control.</p>

<p>The biology of stress and the biology of self-control are simply incompatible. Both the fight-or-flight and pause-and-plan responses are about energy management, but they redirect your energy and attention in very different ways. The
  fight-or-flight response floods the body with energy to act instinctively, and steals it from the areas of the brain needed for wise decision making. The pause-and-plan response sends that energy to the brain - and not just anywhere in the
  brain, but specifically to the self-control centre, the prefrontal cortex. Stress encourages you to focus on immediate, short-term goals and outcomes, but self-control requires keeping the big picture in mind. Learning how to better manage
  your stress is one of the most important things you can do to improve your willpower.</p>

<p>Researchers have also found that too little sleep creates impulse control and attention problems that mimic attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may be that children's sleep habits - which typically mirror their
  parents', despite their even greater need for sleep - are contributing to the dramatic rise in the diagnosis of this disorder.</p>

<h3>Too Tired to Resist: Why Self-Control Is Like a Muscle</h3>

<p>In study after study, no matter what task he used, people's self-control deteriorated over time. A concentration task didn't just lead to worse attention over time; it depleted physical strength. Controlling emotions didn't just lead to
  emotional outbursts; it made people more willing to spend money on something they didn't need. Resisting tempting sweets didn't just trigger cravings for chocolate; it also prompted procrastination. It was as if every act of willpower was
  drawing from the same source of strength, leaving people weaker with each successful act of self-control.</p>

<p>...willpower is a limited resource. Trying to control your temper, stick to a budget, or refuse seconds all tap the same source of strength.</p>

<p>And thanks to the near-constant self-control demands of our society, are we destined to be a nation of willpower-drained zombies, wandering the world seeking instant gratification?</p>

<p>If you never seem to have the time and energy for your <q>I will</q> challenge, schedule it for when you have the most strength.</p>

<p>Low blood sugar levels turn out to predict a wide range of willpower failures, from giving up on a difficult test to lashing out at others when you're angry. Gailliot, now a professor at Zirve University in Turkey, has found that people
  with low blood sugar are also more likely to rely on stereotypes and less likely to donate money to charity or help a stranger. It is as if <em>running low on energy biases us to be the worst versions of ourselves.</em> In contrast, giving
  participants a sugar boost turns them back into the best versions of themselves: more persistent and less impulsive; more thoughtful and less selfish.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: THE WILLPOWER DIET</h3>

<p>Most psychologists and nutritionists recommend a low-glycemic diet - that is, one that helps you keep your blood sugar steady. Low-glycemic foods include lean proteins, nuts and beans, high-fibre grains and cereals, and most fruits and
  vegetables - basically, food that is close to its natural state and doesn't have a ton of added sugar, fat and chemicals. It may take some self-control to shift in this direction, but whatever steps you take (say, eating a hearty and
  healthy breakfast during the working week instead of skipping breakfast, or snacking on nuts instead of sugar) will more than pay you back for any willpower you spend making the change.</p>

<p>Other studies have found that committing to any small, consistent act of self-control - improving your posture, squeezing a handgrip every day until your hand is exhausted, cutting back on sweets, and keeping track of your spending - can
  increase overall willpower. And while these small self-control exercises may seem inconsequential, they appear to improve the willpower challenges we care about most, including focusing at work, taking good care of our health, resisting
  temptation, and feeling more in control of our emotions. </p>

<p>Through each of these willpower exercises, the brain gets used to pausing before acting. The triviality of the assignments may even help this process. The tasks are challenging, but they're not overwhelming. And while the self-restraints
  require careful attention, they're unlikely to trigger strong feelings of deprivation. (<q>What do you mean I'm not allowed to say <q>yeah</q>?!?!? That's the only thing that gets me through the day!</q>) The relative unimportance of the
  willpower challenges allowed participants to exercise the muscle of self-control without the internal angst that derails so many of our attempts to change.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: A WILLPOWER WORKOUT</h3>

  <p>If you want to put yourself through your own willpower-training regime, test the muscle model of self-control with one of the following willpower workouts:
  <p>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li>Strengthen <q>I Won't</q> Power: commit to not swearing (or refraining from any habit of speech), not crossing your legs when you sit, or using your non-dominant hand for a daily task like eating or opening doors.</li>
    <li>Strengthen <q>I Will</q> Power: commit to doing something every day (not something you already do) just for the practice of building a habit and not making excuses. It could be calling your mother, meditating for five minutes, or
      finding one thing in your house that needs to be thrown out or recycled.</li>
    <li>Strengthen Self-Monitoring: formally keep track of something you don't usually pay close attention to. This could be your spending, what you eat, or how much time you spend online or watching TV. You don't need fancy technology -
      pencil and paper will do.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>[Archibald] Hill had proposed that exercise fatigue might be caused not by muscle failure, but by an overprotective monitor in the brain that wanted to prevent exhaustion. When the body was working hard, and putting heavy demands on the
  heart, this monitor (Hill called it <q>the governor</q>) would step in to slow things down. Hill didn't guess at how the brain produced the feeling of fatigue that led athletes to give up, but Noakes was intrigued with the implication:
  physical exhaustion was a trick played on the body by the mind.</p>

<p>Most of us interpret exhaustion as an objective indicator that we cannot continue. This theory says it is just a feeling generated by the brain to motivate us to stop, in much the same way that the feeling of anxiety can stop us from doing
  something dangerous, and the feeling of disgust can stop us from eating something that will make us sick.</p>

<p>Some scientists now believe that the limits of self-control are just like the physical limits of the body - we often feel depleted of willpower before we actually are.</p>
<p>Just as the brain may tell the body's muscles to slow down when it fears physical exhaustion, the brain may put the brakes on its own energy-expensive exercise of the prefrontal cortex. This doesn't mean we're out of willpower; we just
  need to muster up the motivation to use it.</p>

<p>Our beliefs about what we are capable of may determine whether we give up or soldier on. Stanford psychologists have found that some people do not believe the feeling of mental fatigue that follows a challenging act of self-control. These
  willpower athletes also do not show the typical deterioration in self-control that the muscle model predicts...</p>
<p>...the widely observed scientific finding that self-control is limited may reflect our beliefs about willpower, not our true physical and mental limits. ... we often have more willpower than we believe we do. It raises the possibility that
  we can, like athletes, push past the feeling of willpower exhaustion to make it to the finishing line of our own willpower challenges.</p>

<p><em>Our challenge is to train like an intelligent athlete, pushing our limits but also pacing ourselves.</em></p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: IS YOUR EXHAUSTION REAL?</h3>

<p>All too often, we use the first feeling of fatigue as a reason to skip exercise, snap at our spouses, procrastinate a little longer, or order a pizza instead of cooking a healthy meal. To be sure, the demands of life really do drain our
  willpower, and perfect self-control is a fool's quest. But you may have more willpower than the first impulse to give in would suggest. The next time you find yourself <q>too tired</q> to exert self-control, challenge yourself to go beyond
  that first feeling of fatigue. (Keep in mind that it's also possible to overtrain - and if you find yourself constantly feeling drained, you may need to consider whether you have been running yourself to real exhaustion.)</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: WHAT'S YOUR <q>WANT</q> POWER?</h3>

  <p>When your willpower is running low, find renewed strength by tapping into your want power. For your biggest willpower challenge, consider the following motivations:</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>How will you benefit from succeeding at this challenge? What is the benefit for you personally? Greater health, happiness, freedom, financial security or success?</li>
    <li>Who else will benefit if you succeed at this challenge? Surely there are others who depend on you and are affected by your choices. How does your behaviour influence your family, friends, colleagues, employees or employer, and
      community? How would your success help them?</li>
    <li>Imagine that this challenge will get easier for you over time if you are willing to do what is difficult now. Can you imagine what your life will be like, and how you will feel about yourself, as you make progress on this
      challenge? Is some discomfort now worth it if you know it is only a temporary part of your progress?</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>Erin realized that an even bigger motivation was the desire to enjoy being a parent - which is not exactly the same thing as being a better parent.</p>

<p>Sometimes our strongest motivation is not what we think it is, or think it should be. If you're trying to change a behaviour to please someone else or be the right kind of person, see if there is another <q>want</q> that holds more power
  for you.</p>

<em>It's not just a matter of caring; change requires doing.</em></p>

<p>The psychologists who ran this study suggest that people who are willpower-depleted cannot be counted on to make good decisions for society. This is a troubling claim, given what we know about how easy it is to exhaust willpower, and how
  many minor decisions in our daily lives demand self-control. We are not going to solve national or global crises like economic growth, health care, human rights and climate change if we are exhausted by food shopping and dealing with
  difficult colleagues.</p>

<p>Behavioural economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein have argued persuasively for <q>choice architecture</q>, systems that make it easier for people to make good decisions consistent with their values and goals. For
  example, asking people to become organ donors when they renew a driving licence or register to vote. Or having GP practices automatically schedule annual check-ups for patients over the age of fifty. These are things most people mean to do,
  but put off because they are distracted by so many other more pressing demands.</p>

<p>Choice architecture designed to manipulate people's decisions is a controversial proposition. Some see it as restricting individual freedom or ignoring personal responsibility. And yet, people who are free to choose anything most often
  choose against their long-term interests. Research on the limits of self-control suggests that this is not because we are innately irrational, or because we are making deliberate decisions to enjoy today and forget tomorrow. Instead, we may
  simply be too tired to act against our worst impulses. If we want to strengthen self-control, we may need to think about how we can best support the most exhausted version of ourselves - and not count on an ideal version of ourselves to
  turn up and save the day.</p>

<h3>Licence to Sin: Why Being Good Gives Us Permission to Be Bad</h3>

<p>Not every lapse of self-control reflects an actual loss of control. Sometimes we make a conscious choice to give in to temptation.</p>

<p>We'll consider how progress can paradoxically undermine our motivation, how optimism can give us a licence to indulge, and why feeling good about our virtue is the fastest path to vice. In each case, we'll see that giving in is a choice,
  and not an inevitable one.

<p>When it comes to right and wrong, most of us are not striving for moral perfection. We just want to feel good enough - which then gives us permission to do whatever we want.</p>

<p>The moral licensing effect might explain why some people who have obvious moral credentials - a minister, a family values politician, a lawyer prosecuting corruption - can justify to themselves some serious moral lapses, whether it's the
  married preacher having sex with his secretary, the member of Parliament using public funds to remodel his home, or the police officer using extreme force against a non-resisting criminal. Most people don't question their impulses when
  they're feeling virtuous, and some people's positions permanently remind them of their virtue.</p>

<p>If you tell yourself that you're <q>good</q> when you exercise and <q>bad</q> when you don't, then you're more likely to skip the gym tomorrow if you work out today. Tell yourself you're <q>good</q> for working on an important project and
  <q>bad</q> for procrastinating, and you're more likely to slack off in the afternoon if you made progress in the morning. Simply put: whenever we have conflicting desires, being good gives us permission to be a little bit bad.
</p>

<p>They also don't feel guilty. Instead, they report feeling proud of themselves for earning a reward. They offer the justification, <q>I was so good, I deserve a little treat.</q> This sense of entitlement too often becomes our downfall.
  Because we're quick to view self-indulgence as the best reward for virtue, we forget our real goals and give in to temptation.</p>

<p>The worst part of moral licensing is not just its questionable logic; the problem is how it tricks us into acting against our best interests. It convinces us that self-sabotaging behaviour - whether breaking your diet, blowing your budget
  or sneaking a smoke - is a <q>treat.</q></p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: TO REVOKE YOUR LICENCE, REMEMBER THE WHY</h3>

<p>This illustrates a fundamental mistake we make when thinking about our future choices. We wrongly but persistently expect to make different decisions tomorrow than we do today. I'll smoke this one cigarette, but starting tomorrow, I'll
  give up. I'll skip the gym today, but I'm sure I'll go tomorrow. I'll splurge on Christmas gifts, but then no more shopping for at least three months.<br />
  Such optimism licenses us to indulge today - especially if we know we will have the opportunity to choose differently in the near future.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: ARE YOU BORROWING CREDIT FROM TOMORROW?</h3>

<p>As you go about making decisions related to your willpower challenge, notice if the promise of future good behaviour comes up in your thinking. Do you tell yourself you will make up for today's behaviour tomorrow? What effect does this
  have on your self-control today? For extra credit, keep paying attention - all the way to tomorrow. Do you actually do what you said you would, or does the cycle of <q>indulge today, change tomorrow</q> begin again?</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: A TOMORROW JUST LIKE TODAY</h3>

<p>Apply Rachlin's advice to your own willpower challenge this week: aim to reduce the variability of your behaviour day to day. View every choice you make as a commitment to all future choices. So instead of asking, <q>Do I want to eat these
    sweets now?</q> ask yourself, <q>Do I want the consequences of eating these sweets every afternoon for the next year?</q> Or if you've been putting something off that you know you should do, instead of asking <q>Would I rather do this
    today or tomorrow?</q> ask yourself, <q>Do I really want the consequences of always putting this off?</q></p>

<p>Using a daily rule also helps you see through the illusion that what you do tomorrow will be totally different from what you do today. Jeff knew that if he broke his rule one day, he would - according to the experiment's instructions -
  have to break it every day for the rest of the week.</p>

<h3>THE HALO EFFECT</h3>
This allows restaurants and advertisers to add 1 per cent virtue to 99 per cent vice and make us feel good about ourselves even as we sabotage our long-term goals.</p>

<p>The study found that people who actually chose to purchase an eco-friendly product were more likely to then cheat in a test that paid them for each correct answer. They were also more likely to steal extra money out of the envelope they
  were told to collect their payout from. Somehow the virtue of green shopping justified the sins of lying and stealing.</p>
<p>Yale economist Matthew J. Kotchen has raised concerns that small <q>green</q> actions will reduce both consumers' and businesses' guilt, licensing larger harmful behaviours.</p>
<p>So a reusable shopping bag can become a licence to buy more, planting a tree can become licence to travel more, and changing your lightbulbs can become licence to live in a bigger, energy-hungry house.</p>
<p>The good news is, not all green acts are likely to inspire conspicuous consumption and guilt-free carbon binges. University of Melbourne economists have found that a licensing effect is most likely when people pay a <q>penance</q> for bad
  behaviour - for example, paying an extra &#36;2.50 to plant a tree to make up for the carbon costs of your home electricity use. The consumer's general eco-guilt is relieved, increasing the chance that they will feel licensed to consume
  more energy. A similar effect has been found with other well-intentioned penalty policies. For example, daycare centres that charge parents a fine for picking up their children late find that the policy actually increases late pickups.
  Parents can buy the right to be late, erasing their guilt. And because most of us would rather pay a little to do what's easiest, these programmes license us to pass the buck to someone else.</p>
<p>However, when people are given a chance to pay for something that replaces a harmful act with something good for the environment - for example, paying 10 per cent more on your electricity bill to use green sources of energy - no such
  licensing effect is seen. Why not? Economists speculate that this kind of green act doesn't so much reduce guilt as strengthen the consumer's sense of commitment to the environment. When we pay that extra money to use wind or solar energy,
  we think, I'm the kind of person who does good things for the planet! And then we carry that identity with us, looking for more ways to live our values and achieve our goals. If we want to motivate green behaviour in others, we would be
  wise to focus more on strengthening a person's identity as someone who cares about the environment, and less on giving people the opportunity to buy the right to melt the polar ice caps.</p>

<p><em>We need to feel like the kind of person who wants to do the right thing.</em></p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?</h3>

<p>When you think about your willpower challenge, which part of you feels more like the <q>real</q> you - the part of you who wants to pursue the goal, or the part of you who needs to be controlled? Do you identify more with your impulses and
  desires, or with your long-term goals and values? When you think about your willpower challenge, do you feel like the kind of person who can succeed - or do you feel as if you need to fundamentally suppress, improve or change who you are?
</p>

<h3>The Brain's Big Lie: Why We Mistake Wanting for Happiness</h3>

<p><b>The Idea:</b> Our brains mistake the promise of reward for a guarantee of happiness, so we chase satisfaction from things that do not deliver.</p>

<p>It's true that the patients said the shocks felt good. But their near-constant rates of self-stimulation, combined with anxiety about having the current turned off, suggested something other than true satisfaction. What few details we have
  about his patients' thoughts and feelings reveal another side to this seemingly blissful experience. One patient, who suffered from narcolepsy and was given the portable implant to help him stay awake, described the feeling of
  self-stimulation as intensely frustrating. Despite his <q>frequent, sometimes frantic pushing of the button</q>, he was never able to achieve the sense of satisfaction he felt he was close to experiencing. The self-stimulation left him
  anxious, not happy. His behaviour looked more like compulsion than a man experiencing pleasure.</p>
<p>What if Olds and Milner's rats weren't self-stimulating to exhaustion because it felt so good that they didn't want to stop? What if the area of the brain they were stimulating wasn't rewarding them with the experience of profound
  pleasure, but simply promising them the experience of pleasure? Is it possible the rats were self-stimulating because their brains were telling them that if they just pressed that lever one more time, something wonderful was going to
  happen?</p>

<p>Our whole world is full of stimuli - from restaurant menus and catalogues to lottery tickets and television ads - that can turn us into the human version of Olds and Milner's rat chasing the promise of happiness.</p>

<p>How does the reward system compel us to act? When the brain recognizes an opportunity for reward, it releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine tells the rest of the brain what to pay attention to and what to get our greedy
  little hands on. A dopamine rush doesn't create happiness itself - the feeling is more like arousal. We feel alert, awake, and captivated. We recognize the possibility of feeling good and are willing to work for that feeling.
  In the last few years, neuroscientists have given the effect of dopamine release many names, including seeking, wanting, craving and desire. But one thing is clear: it is not the experience of liking, satisfaction, pleasure or actual
  reward.</p>

<p>dopamine's role in anticipating, but not experiencing, reward.</p>

<p>In his study, Knutson put human participants in a brain scanner and conditioned them to expect the opportunity to win money when they saw a special symbol appear on a screen. To win the money, they'd have to press a button to get the
  reward. As soon as the symbol appeared, the brain's dopamine-releasing reward centre lit up, and the participants pressed the button to get their reward. When the participants actually won money, however, this area of the brain quieted
  down. The joy of winning was registered in different areas of the brain. Knutson had proved that dopamine is for action, not happiness. The promise of reward guaranteed that participants wouldn't miss out on the reward by failing to act.
  What they were feeling when the reward system lit up was anticipation, not pleasure.</p>
<p>Anything we think is going to make us feel good will trigger the reward system - the sight of tempting food, the smell of coffee brewing, the 50-per-cent-off sign in a shop window, a smile from a sexy stranger, the advert that promises to
  make you rich. The flood of dopamine marks this new object of desire as critical to your survival. When dopamine hijacks your attention, the mind becomes fixated on obtaining or repeating whatever triggered it.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn't give a damn about happiness itself, but will use the promise of happiness to keep us struggling to stay alive. And so the promise of happiness - not the direct experience of happiness - is the brain's strategy to keep you
  hunting, gathering, working and wooing.</p>
<p>Of course, as with many of our primitive instincts, we find ourselves in a very different environment now than the one the human brain evolved in. Take, for example, the flood of dopamine we experience whenever we see, smell or taste
  high-fat or high-sugar food. That dopamine release guarantees we will want to stuff ourselves silly. This is a great instinct if you live in an environment where food is scarce. But when you live in a world where food is not only widely
  available but also specifically engineered to maximize your dopamine response, following every burst of dopamine is a recipe for obesity, not longevity.</p>
<p>Or consider the effects of sexually graphic images on our reward system. For much of human history, you weren't going to see a naked person posing seductively for you unless the opportunity for mating was real. Certainly a little
  motivation to act in this scenario would be clever if you wanted to keep your DNA in the gene pool. Fast-forward a few hundred thousand years, and we find ourselves in a world where Internet porn is always available, not to mention constant
  exposure to sexual images in advertisements and entertainment. The instinct to pursue every one of these sexual <q>opportunities</q> is how people end up addicted to X-rated websites - and become victims of advertising campaigns that use
  sex to sell everything from deodorant to designer jeans.</p>

<p>...now we have Facebook, Twitter, e-mail and text messaging - the modern equivalent of psychiatrist Robert Heath's self-stimulating devices.<br />
  Because we know there's a chance we'll have a new message, or because the very next YouTube video may be the one that makes us laugh, we keep hitting refresh, clicking the next link and checking our devices compulsively. It's as if our
  mobile phones, BlackBerrys and laptops have a direct line into our brains, giving us constant jolts of dopamine. There are few things ever dreamed of, smoked or injected that have as addictive an effect on our brains as technology. This is
  how our devices keep us captive and always coming back for more. The definitive Internet act of our times is a perfect metaphor for the promise of reward: we search. And we search. And we search some more, clicking that mouse like - well,
  like a rat in a cage seeking another <q>hit</q>, looking for the elusive reward that will finally feel like enough.</p>

<p>...computer and video game designers intentionally manipulate the reward system to keep players hooked. The promise that the next level or big win could happen at any time is what makes a game compelling. It's also what makes a game hard
  to quit. One study found that playing a video game led to dopamine increases equivalent to amphetamine use - and it's this dopamine rush that makes both so addictive. The unpredictability of scoring or advancing keeps your dopamine neurons
  firing, and you glued to your seat.</p>
While not everyone who picks up an Xbox controller gets hooked, for those who are vulnerable, games can be as addictive as any drug. In 2005, a twenty-eight-year-old Korean boiler repairman, Lee Seung Seop, died from cardiovascular failure
after playing the game Star-Craft for fifty hours straight. He had refused to eat or sleep, wanting only to continue. It's impossible to hear this story and not think about Olds and Milner's rats pressing the lever to exhaustion.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHAT GETS YOUR DOPAMINE NEURONS FIRING?</h3>

<p>Do you know what your own dopamine triggers are? Food? Alcohol? Shopping? Facebook? Something else? This week, pay attention to what captures your attention. What unleashes that promise of reward that compels you to seek satisfaction? What
  gets you salivating like Pavlov's dogs or obsessed like Olds and Milner's rats?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking evidence of dopamine's role in addiction comes from patients being treated for Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. The main symptoms
  reflect dopamine's role in motivating action: slow or impaired movement, depression, and occasionally complete catatonia. The standard treatment for Parkinson's disease is a two-drug cocktail: L-dopa, which helps the brain make dopamine,
  and a dopamine agonist, which stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain to mimic the action of dopamine. When patients begin drug therapy, their brains are flooded with a lot more dopamine than they've had in a long time. This relieves the
  main symptoms of the disease, but also creates new problems that no one expected.</p>
<p>Medical journals are full of case studies documenting the unintended side effects of these drugs. There is the fifty-four-year-old woman who developed insatiable cravings for biscuits, crackers and pasta, and would stay up late into the
  night binge-eating. Or the fifty-two-year-old man who developed a daily gambling habit, staying at the casino for thirty-six hours straight and running through his life's savings. Or the forty-nine-year-old man who all of a sudden found
  himself afflicted with an increased appetite, a taste for alcohol, and what his wife called <q>an excessive sex urge</q> that required calling the police to get him to leave her alone. All of these cases were completely resolved by taking
  the patients off the dopamine-enhancing drug. But in many cases, confused loved ones and doctors first sent patients to psychotherapy and Alcoholics or Gamblers Anonymous. They were unable to see that the new addictions were a brain glitch,
  not a deep-seated emotional problem that required psychological and spiritual counselling.</p>

<p>Importantly, even if the reward never arrives, the promise of reward - combined with a growing sense of anxiety when we think about stopping - is enough to keep us hooked.</p>

<p>...fantasizing about winning the lottery leads people to overeat - ... daydreaming about unattainable rewards can get you into trouble. High levels of dopamine amplify the lure of immediate gratification, while making you less concerned
  about long-term consequences.
  Do you know who has worked this out? People who want your money. Many aspects of our retail environment have been designed to keep us always wanting more, from big food companies packing their recipes with just the right combination of
  sugar, salt and fat to drive your dopamine neurons crazy to lotto commercials that encourage you to imagine what you would do with a million dollars if you hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>...most people also believe that they are immune to advertisements, despite ample evidence that TV ads for snack foods make you more likely to hit the fridge - especially if you're a dieter trying to cut back on snacks.</p>

<p>The reward system of the brain also responds to novelty and variety. Your dopamine neurons eventually become less responsive to familiar rewards, even ones you really enjoy, whether it's a daily mocha latte or the same old lunch special.
  It's not a coincidence that places like Starbucks and Pret a Manger are constantly introducing new variations of the standard fare, and clothing retailers roll out new colour choices for their wardrobe basics. Regular cup of coffee? Been
  there, done that. Ah, but what's this on the menu - a white chocolate latte? The thrill is back! Cable-knit sweater in your favourite mail-order catalogue? Boring. But wait, it's now available in salted-caramel brown and melted-butter
  yellow? Dopamine days are here again!</p>

<p>An appetizing odour is one of the fastest ways to trigger the promise of reward, and as soon as the scented molecules land on your olfactory receptors, the brain will begin searching for the source. The next time you walk by a fast-food
  restaurant and are tempted by the smell of chips and burgers, it's a safe bet you're not smelling the food inside, but a carefully manufactured Eau de Eat More being piped onto the pavement through special vents. The website of Scent Air, a
  leader in the field of scent marketing, brags about how it lured visitors into an ice cream parlour on the lower level of a hotel. With a strategically placed aroma-delivery system, they released the scent of sugary biscuits to the top of
  the stairs and waffle cones to the bottom. The average passerby will think she is inhaling the authentic smell of the sweet treats. Instead, she is breathing in enhanced chemicals designed to maximize the firing of her dopamine neurons and
  lead her - and her wallet - straight down the stairs. For Bloomingdale's department store in New York, the company varied the scents: Baby Powder to trigger warm and fuzzy feelings in the maternity department, Coconut in the swimsuit
  department to inspire fantasies of cocktails on the beach, and the <q>soothing scent of Lilac</q> for the intimate apparel department, presumably to calm down women standing naked under fluorescent lighting in front of a three-way
  changing-room mirror. You may not even consciously notice these scents, but they can influence your brain and your shopping all the same.</p>

<p>A Florida hospital's MRI department reduced its last-minute appointment-cancellation rates by introducing Coconut Beach and Ocean fragrances into the waiting areas. A little promise of reward can be a powerful antidote to anxiety, and help
  people approach things they would rather avoid. Other industries and service providers might benefit from a similar strategy - perhaps dentists could infuse their offices with the scent of candy floss, and tax advisers might choose gin and
  tonic.</p>

<p>Students return the next week with stories of how their favourite shops are manipulating them, from the scented candles burning in the kitchenware shop to the scratch-and-win discount cards handed out to shoppers at the shopping centre.
  They recognize why a clothing company has pictures of naked models on its walls, and why auctioneers open the bidding at bargain prices.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: DOPAMINIZE YOUR <q>I WILL</q> POWER CHALLENGE</h3>

<p>My students have dopaminized tasks they typically put off by using music, fashion magazines and television to help them exercise; bringing dreaded paperwork to a favourite cafe and finishing it over hot chocolate; and, in a truly creative
  gesture, buying a bunch of scratch-off lottery tickets and placing them next to procrastinated projects around the house. Others visualize the best-possible outcome of their hard work, to make the far away rewards seem more real. If there's
  something you've been putting off because it's so unpleasant, can you motivate yourself by linking it to something that gets your dopamine neurons firing?</p>

<h3>THE DARK SIDE OF DOPAMINE</h3>

<p>...the promise of reward can be as stressful as it is delightful. Desire doesn't always make us feel good - sometimes it makes us feel downright rotten. That's because dopamine's primary function is to make us pursue happiness, not to make
  us happy. It doesn't mind putting a little pressure on us - even if that means making us unhappy in the process.</p>

<p>When your reward centre releases dopamine, it also sends a message to the brain's stress centre. In this area of the brain, dopamine triggers the release of stress hormones. The result: you feel anxious as you anticipate your object of
  desire. The need to get what you want starts to feel like a life-or-death emergency, a matter of survival.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: THE STRESS OF DESIRE</h3>

<p>Most of us pay far more attention to the promise of feeling good than the actual feeling bad that accompanies dopamine-drive desire. This week, see if you can notice when wanting triggers stress and anxiety. If you give in to temptation,
  do you feel as if you are responding to the promise of reward? Or are you trying to relieve the anxiety?</p>

<p>Just think of your own biggest <q>I won't</q> power challenge. Chances are this is something you believe makes you happy - or would make you happy, if you could just get enough of it. But a careful analysis of the experience and its
  consequences often reveals the opposite. At best, giving in takes away the anxiety that the promise of reward produces to make you want it more. But ultimately, you're left frustrated, dissatisfied, disappointed, ashamed, tired, sick, or
  simply no happier than when you started.</p>

<p>For example, when overeaters slow down and really experience a food that usually triggers cravings and bingeing, they typically notice that the food looks and smells better than it tastes; even with the mouth and stomach full, the brain
  begs for more; their feelings of anxiety only increase as they eat more; sometimes they don't even taste the food when they're bingeing, because they're eating so fast; and they feel worse physically and emotionally afterward than they did
  before. At first, this can be disturbing - after all, they had really believed that food was a source of happiness. However, the research shows that people who practise this mindful-eating exercise develop greater self-control around food
  and have fewer episodes of binge-eating. Over time, they not only lose weight, but they also experience less stress, anxiety and depression. When we free ourselves from the false promise of reward, we often find that the thing we were
  seeking happiness from was the main source of our misery.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: TEST THE PROMISE OF REWARD</h3>

<p>Test the promise of reward with a temptation that you regularly indulge in because your brain tells you it will make you happy. The most common choices in my class are snack foods, shopping, television and online time-wasters from e-mail
  to poker. Mindfully indulge, but don't rush through the experience. Notice what the promise of reward feels like: the anticipation, the hope, the excitement, the anxiety, the salivation - whatever is going on in your brain and body. Then
  give yourself permission to give in. How does the experience compare with the expectation? Does the feeling of the promise of reward ever go away - or does it continue to drive you to eat more, spend more, or stay longer? When, if ever, do
  you become satisfied? Or do you simply reach the point of being unable to continue, because you're stuffed, exhausted, frustrated, out of time, or out of the <q>reward</q>?</p>
<p>People who try this exercise commonly have one of two results. Some people find that when they really pay attention to the experience of indulging, they need far less than they thought they would to feel satisfied. [example of the woman
  who just needed window-shopping to feel satisfied, not actually spending money] Others find that the experience is completely unsatisfying, revealing a huge gap between the promise of reward and the reality of their experience. Both
  observations can give you greater control over what has felt like an out-of-control behaviour.</p>

<h3>THE PARADOX OF REWARD</h3>

<p>The promise of reward doesn't guarantee happiness, but no promise of reward guarantees unhappiness. Listen to the promise of reward, and we give in to temptation. Without the promise of reward, we have no motivation.</p>

<p>It's clear that we need the promise of reward to keep us interested and engaged in life.</p>

<p>If we are to have any self-control, we need to separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that keep us distracted and addicted.</p>

<h3>What the Hell: How Feeling Bad Leads to Giving In</h3>

<p>The brain, it turns out, is especially susceptible to temptation when we're feeling bad.</p>

<p>When smokers imagine a trip to the dentist, they experience off-the-chart cravings for a cigarette. When binge-eaters are told they will have to give a speech in public, they crave high-fat, sugary foods.</p>

<p>Neuroscientists have shown that stress - including negative emotions like anger, sadness, self-doubt and anxiety - shifts the brain into a reward-seeking state. You end up craving whatever substance or activity your brain associates with
  the promise of reward, and you become convinced that the <q>reward</q> is the only way to feel better.</p>

<p>The stress hormones released during a fight-or-flight response also increase the excitability of your dopamine neurons. That means that when you're under stress, any temptations you run into will be even more tempting.</p>

<p>Stress points us in the wrong direction, away from our clear-headed wisdom and towards our least helpful instincts. That's the power of the one-two punch of stress and dopamine: we are drawn back again and again to coping strategies that
  don't work, but that our primitive brains persistently believe are the gateway to bliss.</p>

<p>The promise of reward combined with the promise of relief can lead to all sorts of illogical behaviour. For example, one economic survey found that women worried about their finances shop to cope with their anxiety and depression. Yes, you
  read that right: shop. It defies reason - they're just adding to their credit card debt, which will make them feel even more overwhelmed later on. But it makes perfect sense to a brain that just wants to feel better now. If you believe at
  some level that buying things makes you feel better, you will shop to relieve debt-induced stress. Binge-eaters who feel ashamed of their weight and lack of control around food turn to - what else? - more food to fix their feelings.
  Procrastinators who are stressed about how behind they are on a project will put it off even longer to avoid having to think about it. In each of these cases, the goal to feel better trumps the goal of self-control.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: THE PROMISE OF RELIEF</h3>

<p>What do you turn to when you're feeling stressed, anxious or down? Are you more susceptible to temptation when you are upset? Are you more easily distracted, or more likely to procrastinate? How does feeling bad affect your willpower
  challenge?</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: TRY A STRESS-RELIEF STRATEGY THAT WORKS</h3>

<p>While many of the most popular stress-relief strategies fail to make us feel better, some strategies really work. According to the American Psychological Association, <em>the most effective stress-relief strategies are exercising or
    playing sports, praying or attending a religious service, reading, listening to music, spending time with friends or family, getting a massage, going outside for a walk, meditating or doing yoga, and spending time on a creative
    hobby.</em> (The least effective strategies are gambling, shopping, smoking, drinking, eating, playing video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV or films for more than two hours.)</p>
<p>The main difference between the strategies that work and the strategies that don't? Rather than releasing dopamine and relying on the promise of reward, the real stress relievers boost mood-enhancing brain chemicals like serotonin and
  GABA, as well as the feel-good hormone oxytocin. They also help shut down the brain's stress response, reduce stress hormones in the body, and induce the healing relaxation response. Because they aren't exciting like the dopamine releasers,
  we tend to underestimate how good they will make us feel. And so we forget about these strategies not because they don't work, but because when we're stressed, our brains persistently mispredict what will make us happy. This means that
  we'll often talk ourselves out of doing the very thing that will actually make us feel better.</p>
<p>The next time you're feeling stressed and about to reach for the promise of relief, consider trying a more effective stress reliever instead.</p>

<p>As part of our class experiment, Denise committed to doing yoga at least once. When she did, she felt even better than she had remembered and couldn't believe she had talked herself out of it for almost three years. Knowing that she was
  likely to forget again and fall into her old routine, she made a voice memo on her phone after class one evening, describing how good she felt after doing yoga.</p>

<p>Is there a way to remind your stressed self what actually makes you feel better?<br />
  What encouragement can you create for yourself before you are stressed?</p>

<h3>IF YOU EAT THIS BISCUIT, THE TERRORISTS WIN</h3>

<p>According to terror-management theory, human beings are - naturally - terrified when we think about our own deaths. It's the one threat we can try to avoid but will never escape. Whenever we are reminded of our mortality (say, every
  twenty-nine seconds on the evening news), it triggers a panic response in the brain. We aren't always aware of it - the anxiety may be just below the surface, creating a free-floating sense of discomfort, without our knowing why. Even when
  it's outside our conscious awareness, this terror creates an immediate need to do something to counter our feelings of powerlessness. We will reach for our security blankets, whatever makes us feel safe, powerful or comforted. ... We don't
  just cling to guns and God when we're scared; thankfully, few of us own guns in the UK, but instead, many of us cling to credit cards, cakes and cigarettes. Studies show that being reminded of our mortality makes us more susceptible to all
  sorts of temptations, as we look for hope and security in the things that promise reward and relief.

<p>Another study found that reports of death on the news make viewers respond more positively to advertisements for status products, like luxury cars and Rolex watches. It's not that we think a Rolex will protect us from a missile attack -
  it's that these goods bolster our self-image and make us feel powerful. For many people, buying things is an immediate way to feel more optimistic and in control.

<p>It doesn't take planes flying into buildings to press our inner panic buttons. In fact, it doesn't even take real deaths to set us spending - television dramas and films can have the same effect.</p>

<p>This, no doubt, is how we end up with half the purchases that clutter our homes and pad our credit card bills. We're feeling a little down, we come across an opportunity to purchase something and a little voice - OK, a few dopamine neurons
  - in our head tell us, <q>Buy this - it's everything you never knew you wanted!</q></p>

<p>Case in point: warnings on cigarette packets can increase a smoker's urge to light up. A 2009 study found that health warnings trigger stress and fear in smokers - exactly what public health officials hope for. Unfortunately, this anxiety
  then triggers smokers' default stress-relief strategy: smoking.</p>
<p>Stress triggers cravings and makes dopamine neurons even more excited by any temptation in sight. It doesn't help that the smoker is - of course - staring at a pack of cigarettes as he reads the warning. So even as a smoker's brain encodes
  the words <q>WARNING: Cigarettes cause cancer</q> and grapples with awareness of his own mortality, another part of his brain starts screaming, <q>Don't worry, smoking a cigarette will make you feel better!</q></p>

<p>Sometimes terror management leads us not into temptation, but procrastination. Many of the most put-off tasks have a whiff of mortality salience about them: making a doctor's appointment, filling a prescription and taking it when we're
  supposed to, taking care of legal documents such as wills, saving for retirement, even throwing out things we're never going to use again, or clothes we'll never fit into. If there's something you've been putting off or keep
  <q>forgetting</q> to do, is it possible that you are trying to avoid facing your vulnerability?
</p>

<p>If the world doesn't end without you watching every private and global crisis unfold (prediction: it won't), consider cutting out mindless consumption of these media.</p>

<p>Welcome to one of the biggest threats to willpower worldwide: the <q>what-the-hell effect</q>. First coined by dieting researchers Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman, the what-the-hell effect describes a cycle of indulgence, regret, and
  greater indulgence. These researchers noticed that many dieters would feel so bad about any lapse - a piece of pizza, a bite of cake - that they felt as if their whole diet was blown. Instead of minimizing the harm by not taking another
  bite, they would say, <q>What the hell, I've already blown my diet. I might as well eat the whole thing.</q></p>

<p>Whatever the willpower challenge, the pattern is the same. Giving in makes you feel bad about yourself, which motivates you to do something to feel better. And what's the cheapest, fastest strategy for feeling better? Often the very thing
  you feel bad about. That's how eating a few crisps becomes looking for crumbs at the bottom of an empty, greasy bag. Or how losing &#36;100 on the horses can trigger a gambling binge. You say to yourself, <q>I've already broken my [diet,
    budget, sobriety, resolution], so what the hell. I might as well really enjoy myself.</q> Crucially, it's not the first giving-in that guarantees the bigger relapse. It's the feelings of shame, guilt, loss of control and loss of hope that
  follow the first relapse.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHEN SETBACKS HAPPEN</h3>

<p>This week, pay special attention to how you handle any willpower failure. Do you criticize yourself and tell yourself that you'll never change? Do you feel this setback reveals what is wrong with you - that you're lazy, stupid, greedy or
  incompetent? Do you feel hopeless, guilty, ashamed, angry or overwhelmed? Do you use the setback as an excuse to indulge further?</p>

<p>...children are wild animals. The brain's self-control system does not fully develop until young adulthood, and kids need some external support while their prefrontal cortices fill out. However, many people treat themselves as if they are
  still children - and frankly, they act more like abusive parents than supportive caregivers.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: FORGIVENESS WHEN YOU FAIL</h3>

  <p>Below is an exercise that psychologists use to help people find a more self-compassionate response to failure. Research shows that taking this point of view reduces guilt but increases personal accountability - the perfect combination to
    get you back on track with your willpower challenge. Bring to mind a specific time when you gave in to temptation or procrastination, and experiment with taking the following three points of view on that failure. When you experience a
    setback, you can bring these perspectives to mind to help you avoid a downward spiral of guilt, shame and giving in again.</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>
      What are you feeling? As you think about this failure, take a moment to notice and describe how you are feeling. What emotions are present? What are you are feeling in your body? Can you remember how you felt immediately after the
      failure? How would you describe that? Notice if self-criticism comes up, and if it does, what you say to yourself. The perspective of mindfulness allows you to see what you are feeling without rushing to escape.</li>
    <li>
      You're only human. Everyone struggles with willpower challenges and everyone sometimes loses control. This is just a part of the human condition, and your setback does not mean there is something wrong with you. Consider the truth of
      these statements. Can you think of other people you respect and care about who have experienced similar struggles and setbacks? This perspective can soften the usual voice of self-criticism and self-doubt.</li>
    <li>
      What would you say to a friend? Consider how you would comfort a close friend who experienced the same setback. What words of support would you offer? How would you encourage them to continue pursuing their goal? This perspective
      will point the way to getting back on track.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p>
  To find a more compassionate response to himself, he imagined how he would mentor a student who wanted to give up a goal. Ben realized he would encourage the student to keep going if the goal was important. He would say that any effort made
  now would take the student closer to the goal.</p>

<p>Vowing to change fills us with hope. We love to imagine how making the change will transform our lives, and we fantasize about the person we will become. Research shows that deciding to start a diet makes people feel stronger, and planning
  to exercise makes people feel taller. (Nobody said these fantasies were realistic.) People will treat us differently, we tell ourselves. Everything will be different. The bigger the goal, the bigger the burst of hope. And so when we decide
  to change, it's tempting to give ourselves some very large assignments. Why set a modest goal when setting a gigantic goal will make us feel even better? Why start small when you can dream big?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promise of change - like the promise of reward and the promise of relief - rarely delivers what we're expecting. Unrealistic optimism may make us feel good in the moment, but it sets us up to feel much worse later on.
  The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification - you get all the good feelings before anything's been done. But the challenge of actually making a change can be a rude awakening, and the initial rewards are rarely as
  transformative as our most hopeful fantasies (<q>I lost five pounds, and I still have a crappy job!</q>). As we face our first setbacks, the initial feel-good rush of deciding to change is replaced with disappointment and frustration.
  Failing to meet our expectations triggers the same old guilt, depression and self-doubt, and the emotional payoff of vowing to change is gone. At this point, most people will abandon their efforts altogether.</p>

<p>Polivy and Herman call this cycle the <q>false hope syndrome</q>. As a strategy for change, it fails. But that's because it was never meant to be a strategy for change. It's a strategy for feeling better, and these are not the same thing.
</p>

<p>Resolving to change is, for most people, the best part of the change process. It's all downhill after that: having to exert self-control, saying no when you want to say yes, saying yes when you want to say no. The effort of actually making
  the change cannot compare, from a happiness point of view, to the rush of imagining that you will change. And so it's not only easier, but also much more fun, to milk the promise of change for all it's worth, without the messy business of
  following through. That is why so many people are happier giving up and starting again, over and over, rather than finding a way to make a change for good. The high we get from imagining our own extreme makeovers is a difficult drug to
  quit.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: RESOLVING TO FEEL GOOD</h3>

<p>Take a moment to think about your own motivations and expectations for change. Do you only feel motivated to change when you are feeling bad? Is the best part of setting goals the pleasure of imagining how succeeding will change your life?
  Do you use fantasies of your future self to fix your feelings now, more than you take concrete steps to fix your behaviour?</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: OPTIMISTIC PESSIMISM FOR SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTIONS</h3>

<p>Predict how and when you might be tempted to break your vow, and imagine a specific plan of action for not giving in.</p>

<p>For your own willpower challenge, ask yourself: when am I most likely to be tempted to give in? How am I most likely to let myself get distracted from my goal? What will I say to myself to give myself permission to procrastinate? When you
  have such a scenario in mind, imagine yourself in that situation, what it will feel like, and what you might be thinking. Let yourself see how a typical willpower failure unfolds.</p>
<p>Then turn this imaginary failure into a willpower success. Consider what specific actions you could take to stick to your resolution. Do you need to remember your motivation? Get yourself away from the temptation? Call a friend for
  support? Use one of the other willpower strategies you've learned?</p>
<p>Planning for failure in this way is an act of self-compassion, not self-doubt. When that moment of possible willpower failure hits, you will be ready to put your plan into action.</p>

<h3>Putting the Future on Sale: The Economics of Instant Gratification</h3>

<p>Whether we look to economics, psychology or neuroscience for an explanation, many of our problems with temptation and procrastination come back to one uniquely human problem: how we think about the future. Harvard psychologist Daniel
  Gilbert has made the bold claim that humans are the only species to think in any meaningful way about the future.</p>

<p>Economists call this delay discounting - the longer you have to wait for a reward, the less it is worth to you. Even small delays can dramatically lower the perceived value. With a delay of just two minutes, six M&M's became worth less
  than two immediate M&M's. The value of each M&M shrank as it became more distant.</p>
<p>Delay discounting explains not just why some college kids took two M&M's instead of six, but why we choose immediate satisfaction at the cost of future happiness.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: HOW ARE YOU DISCOUNTING FUTURE REWARDS?</h3>

<p>For your willpower challenge, ask yourself what future rewards you put on sale each time you give in to temptation or procrastination. What is the immediate payoff for giving in? What is the long-term cost? Is this a fair trade? If the
  rational you says, <q>No, it's a terrible deal!</q> try to catch the moment you reverse your preferences. What are you thinking and feeling that lets you put the future on sale?</p>

<p>Behavioural economists call this the problem of bounded rationality - we're rational until we aren't. We will be perfectly rational when everything is in theory, but when the temptation is real, the brain shifts into reward-seeking mode to
  make sure we don't miss out.</p>

<p>When our modern selves contemplate immediate versus future rewards, the brain processes these two options very differently. The immediate reward triggers the older, more primitive reward system and its dopamine-induced desire. Future
  rewards don't interest this reward system so much. Their value is encoded by the more recently evolved prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>The good news is, temptation has a narrow window of opportunity. To really overwhelm our prefrontal cortex, the reward must be available now, and - for maximum effect - you need to see it. As soon as there is any distance between you and
  the temptation, the balance of power shifts back to the brain's system of self-control.</p>

<p>This is good news for those who want to delay gratification. Anything you can do to create that distance will make it easier to say no. For example, one study found that just putting a sweet jar inside a desk drawer instead of on top of
  the desk reduced office workers' sweet consumption by one third. It isn't any more difficult to open a drawer than to reach across a desk, but putting the sweets away reduced the constant stimulation of desire. When you know your own
  triggers, putting them out of sight can keep them from tempting your mind.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: WAIT TEN MINUTES</h3>

<p>When immediate gratification comes with a mandatory ten-minute delay, the brain treats it like a future reward. The promise-of-reward system is less activated, taking away the powerful biological impulse to choose immediate gratification.
  When the brain compares a biscuit you have to wait ten minutes for to a longer-term reward, like losing weight, it no longer shows the same lopsided bias toward the sooner reward. It's the <q>immediate</q> in immediate gratification that
  hijacks your brain and reverses your preferences.</p>
<p>For a cooler, wiser brain, institute a mandatory ten-minute wait for any temptation. If, in ten minutes, you still want it, you can have it - but before the ten minutes are up, bring to mind the competing long-term reward that will come
  with resisting temptation. If possible, create some physical (or visual) distance as well.</p>
<p>If your willpower challenge requires <q>I will</q> power, you can still use the ten-minute rule to help you overcome the temptation to procrastinate. Switch the rule to <q>Do ten minutes, then you can stop.</q> When your ten minutes are
  up, give yourself permission to stop - although you may find that once you get started, you'll want to keep going.</p>

<p>Being able to wait fifteen minutes for two marshmallows was the perfect measure of something far more important: how well could a child handle temporary discomfort to accomplish a long-term goal? And did the child know how to turn the mind
  away from the promise of immediate reward?</p>

<p>And if the present is more important than the future, there is no reason to delay gratification. To escape this mindset, we must find a way to make the future matter.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: LOWER YOUR DISCOUNT RATE</h3>

  <p>Imagine I give you a &#36;100 cheque that can be cashed in ninety days. Then I try to bargain with you. Would you be willing to trade it in for a &#36;50 cheque that can be cashed today? Most people would not. However, if people are
    first given the &#36;50 cheque, and then asked if they'd be willing to exchange it for a &#36;100 delayed reward, most will not. The reward you start with is the one you want to keep.</p>
  <p>One reason is that most people are loss-averse - that is, we really don't like to lose something we already have. Losing &#36;50 makes people more unhappy than getting &#36;50 makes them happy.</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>When you are tempted to act against your long-term interests, frame the choice as giving up the best possible long-term reward for whatever the immediate gratification is.</li>
    <li>Imagine that long-term reward as already yours. Imagine your future self enjoying the fruits of your self-control.</li>
    <li>Then ask yourself: are you willing to give that up in exchange for whatever fleeting pleasure is tempting you now?</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h3>NO WAY OUT: THE VALUE OF PRECOMMITMENT</h3>

<p>Schelling believed that to reach our goals, we must limit our options. He called this precommitment. Schelling borrowed the idea of precommitment from his work on nuclear deterrence. A nation that precommits itself - say, by adopting a
  policy of immediate and escalated retaliation - makes its threats more credible than a nation that expresses reluctance to retaliate. Schelling viewed the rational self and the tempted self as engaged in a war, each with very different
  goals. Your rational self sets a course of action for you to follow, but often the tempted self decides to change course at the last minute. If the tempted self, with its reversed preferences, is allowed to do what it wants, the result will
  ultimately be self-sabotage.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the tempted self is an unpredictable and unreliable enemy. As behavioural economist George Ainslie puts it, we need to <q>take steps to predict and constrain that self as if it were another person</q>. This
  requires cunning, courage and creativity. We must study our tempted selves, see their weaknesses, and find a way to bind them to our rational preferences.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: PRECOMMIT YOUR FUTURE SELF</h3>

  <p>This week, commit yourself from a clear distance. Pick one of the following strategies and apply it to your willpower challenge.</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>
      Create a new default. Make choices in advance and from a clear distance, before your future self is blinded by temptation. For example, you can pack a healthy lunch before you're hungry and salivating over takeaway menus. You can
      schedule and prepay for anything from personal training sessions to dental appointments. What can you do to make it easier for your future self to act on your rational preferences?</li>
    <li>Make it more difficult to reverse your preferences. Like Cortes sinking his ships, find a way to eliminate the easiest route to giving in. Get rid of temptation in your home or office. Don't carry your credit cards when you go
      shopping, and only bring as much cash as you want to spend. Put your alarm clock across the room so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off. None of these things make it impossible to change your mind - but they will at least make
      it inconvenient. What can you do that would put a delay or roadblock between your feelings of temptation and your ability to act on them?</li>
    <li>Motivate your future self. There is no shame in using a carrot or a stick to nudge yourself toward long-term health and happiness. ... finding a way to make immediate gratification more painful if you give in. ...The reward's value
      may stay the same, but the cost of giving in makes immediate gratification far less tempting.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h3>MEET YOUR FUTURE SELF</h3>

<p>I'd like to introduce you to two people I think you'll really get along with. This first is You. You is prone to procrastination, has trouble controlling impulses, and doesn't really like to exercise, finish up paperwork, or do the
  laundry. The second is, um, also named You. For convenience, let's call this person You 2.0. You 2.0 has no trouble with procrastination because You 2.0 has boundless energy for all tasks, no matter how boring or difficult. You 2.0 also has
  amazing self-control, and is able to face down crisps, the TV shopping channels, and inappropriate sexual advances with neither a craving nor a tremble.</p>
<p>Who are You and You 2.0? You is the person reading this chapter, perhaps feeling a little tired and cranky from lack of sleep and overwhelmed by the ten other things you need to do today. You 2.0 is future you. No, not the person you'll
  magically become when you finish the last page of this book. Future you is the person you imagine when you wonder whether you should clear out your wardrobe today or leave it to your future self. Future you is the person who will be much
  more enthusiastic about exercising than you are right now. Future you is the person who will order the healthiest item on the fast-food menu, so that present you can enjoy the burger so artery-clogging, you must sign a legal waiver to order
  it.</p>

<p>It is one of the most puzzling but predictable mental errors humans make: we think about our future selves like different people. We often idealize them, expecting our future selves to do what our present selves cannot manage. Sometimes we
  mistreat them, burdening them with the consequences of our present selves' decisions. Sometimes we simply misunderstand them, failing to realize that they will have the same thoughts and feelings as our present selves. However we think of
  our future selves, rarely do we see them as fully us.</p>

<p>Even as we're in the middle of a self-control conflict, we foolishly expect that our future selves will be unconflicted. The future self keeps being pushed into the future, like a deus ex machina that will emerge to save us from our
  present selves in the very last act. We put off what we need to do because we are waiting for someone else to turn up who will find the change effortless.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: ARE YOU WAITING FOR FUTURE YOU?</h3>

<p>Is there an important change or task you're putting off, hoping that a future you with more willpower will turn up? Do you optimistically overcommit yourself to responsibilities, only to find yourself overwhelmed by impossible demands? Do
  you talk yourself out of something today, telling yourself that you'll feel more like it tomorrow?</p>

<p>Brain-imaging studies show that we even use different regions of the brain to think about our present selves and our future selves. When people imagine enjoying a future experience, the brain areas associated with thinking about oneself
  are surprisingly unengaged. It's as if we are picturing someone else enjoying the sunset or savouring the meal. The same is true when people are asked to consider whether certain traits describe their present selves or their future selves.
  When reflecting on the future self, the brain's activation is identical to when it is considering the traits of another person. It's as if we are observing a person from the outside to decide what is true about them, rather than looking
  within to decide what is true of ourselves.</p>

<h3>WHEN YOUR FUTURE SELF IS A STRANGER</h3>

<p>Hal Ersner-Hershfield, a psychologist at New York University, believes that this self-interest is behind one of the biggest challenges facing our aging society. People are living longer but retiring at the same age, and most have not
  financially prepared themselves for the extra years. It is estimated that two-thirds of Baby Boomers have not saved enough money to maintain their standard of living in retirement. In fact, a 2011 survey found that a fifth of people in the
  UK had absolutely zero retirement savings, and 49 per cent are failing to save enough for their retirement. Ersner-Hershfield (a young guy himself, who at the time, did not have much saved) thought that maybe people were not saving for
  their future selves because it felt like putting money away for a stranger.</p>
<p>To find out, he created a measure of <q>future-self continuity</q> - the degree to which you see your future self as essentially the same person as your current self. Not everyone views the future self as a total stranger; some of us feel
  quite close and connected to our future selves.</p>

<p>If feeling estranged from your future self leads to short-sighted financial decisions, can getting to know your future self lead to greater savings? Ersner-Hershfield decided to test this possibility by introducing college students to
  their retirement-age selves. Working with professional computer animators using age-progression software, he created three-dimensional avatars of participants as they would look at retirement age. Ersner-Hershfield's aim was to help his
  young participants feel like the age-progression really was them - not a relative (the most common response from students was, <q>That looks just like Uncle Joe [or Aunt Sally]!</q>), and not a creature from a horror film. To get to know
  their future selves, the students interacted with their age-advanced avatars in an immersive virtual reality setup. The participants sat in front of a mirror, but they saw reflected their future selves. If the participant moved her head,
  her future self moved her head. If she turned sideways, her future self turned sideways. While participants watched their future selves in the mirror, an experimenter asked each participant questions, such as <q>What is your name?</q>
  <q>Where are you from?</q> and <q>What is your passion in life?</q> As the participant answered, it appeared as though the future self was speaking.
</p>
<p>After spending time with their future selves, participants left the virtual reality lab and began a hypothetical budgeting task. They were given $1,000 and asked to divvy it up among present expenses, a fun splurge, a current account and a
  pension. Students who had interacted with their future selves put more than twice as much money into their pensions as students who had spent time looking at their young selves in a real mirror. Getting to know their future selves made the
  students more willing to invest in them - and, by extension, themselves.</p>
<p>Although the technology is not yet widely available, one can imagine the day when every human resources office has new employees interact with their future selves before enrolling in the company's pension scheme.</p>
<p>Strengthening your future-self continuity can do more than fatten your savings - it can help you with any willpower challenge. High future-self continuity seems to propel people to be the best version of themselves now. For example,
  Ersner-Hershfield noticed that people high in future-self continuity were more likely to arrive for the study on time, and people low in future-self continuity were more likely to cancel and have to reschedule. Struck by this accidental
  finding, he began to explore how future-self continuity affects ethical decision making. His most recent work shows that people with low future-self continuity behave less ethically in business role-play scenarios. They are more likely to
  pocket money found in the office, and more comfortable leaking information that could ruin another person's career. They also lie more in a game that rewards deception with money. It is as if feeling disconnected from our future selves
  gives us permission to ignore the consequences of our actions. In contrast, feeling connected to our future selves protects us from our worst impulses.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: MEET YOUR FUTURE SELF</h3>

  <p>You can help yourself make wiser choices by sending yourself to the future (DeLorean not required). Below are three ideas for making the future feel real, and for getting to know your future self. Pick one that appeals to you and try it
    out this week.</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>
      Create a Future Memory.
      <p>...imagining the future helps people delay gratification. You don't even need to think about the future rewards of delaying gratification - just thinking about the future seems to work.
      <p>When you picture the future, the brain begins to think more concretely and immediately about the consequences of your present choices. The more real and vivid the future feels, the more likely you are to make a decision that your
        future self won't regret.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Send a Message to Your Future Self.
      <p>Why not take advantage of the opportunity to think about what your future self will be doing, and how he or she will feel about the choices you're making now? Describe to your future self what you are going to do now to help yourself
        meet your long-term goals. What are your hopes for your future self? What do you think you will be like? You can also imagine your future self looking back on your present self. What would your future self thank you for, if you were
        able to commit to it today? Psychologist Hal Ersner-Hershfield says that even if you just briefly contemplate what you'd write in such a letter, you will feel more connected to your future self.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Imagine Your Future Self. <p>Studies show that imagining your future self can increase your present self's willpower. One experiment asked couch potatoes to imagine either a hoped-for future self who exercised regularly and enjoyed
        excellent health and energy, or a feared future self who was inactive and suffering the health consequences. Both visualizations got them off the couch, and they were exercising more frequently two months later than a control group
        that did not imagine a future self. For your willpower challenge, can you imagine a hoped-for future self who is committed to the change, and reaping the benefits? Or a future self suffering the consequences of not changing? Let
        yourself daydream in vivid detail, imagining how you will feel, how you will look, and what pride, gratitude, or regret you will have for your past self's choices.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: ARE YOU TOO FARSIGHTED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD?</h3>

<p>Do you have a hard time taking a break from work because there is always more to do? Do you feel so guilty or anxious about spending money that you find it hard to purchase anything beyond the absolute basics? Do you ever look back at how
  you have spent your time and money, and wish you had been more focused on your present happiness instead of always putting it off? If so, take the willpower experiments in this chapter and turn them into strategies for self-indulgence. (And
  try not to put it off, will you?)</p>

<h3>Infected! Why Willpower Is Contagious</h3>

<p>...behaviours we typically view as being under self-control are, in important ways, under social control as well. We like to believe that our choices are immune to the influence of others, and we pride ourselves on our independence and
  free will. But research from the fields of psychology, marketing, and medicine reveals that our individual choices are powerfully shaped by what other people think, want and do - and what we think they want us to do. As you'll see, this
  social influence often gets us into trouble. However, it can also help us meet our willpower goals. Willpower failures may be contagious, but you can also catch self-control.</p>

<p>Obesity was infectious, spreading within families and from friend to friend. When a friend became obese, a person's own future risk of becoming obese increased by 171 per cent. A woman whose sister became obese had a 67 per cent increased
  risk, and a man whose brother became obese had a 45 per cent increased risk.</p>
<p>Obesity wasn't the only thing going around the Framingham community. When one person started drinking more, the bar bills and hangovers spread throughout the social network too. But they also found evidence for the contagiousness of
  self-control. When one person gave up cigarettes, it increased the odds that their friends and family would give up too. Christakis and Fowler have found the same pattern of contagion in other communities, and for willpower challenges as
  diverse as drug use, sleep deprivation and depression. As unsettling as it may be, the implication is clear: both bad habits and positive change can spread from person to person like germs, and nobody is completely immune.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK</h3>

  <p>Not every willpower challenge is the result of a social <q>infection</q>, but with most challenges, there is a social influence. For your own willpower challenge, consider:</p>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li>Do others in your social network share your willpower challenge?</li>
    <li>Looking back, did you pick up the habit from a friend or family member?</li>
    <li>Are there certain people you're more likely to indulge with?</li>
    <li>Have other people in your network recently attempted to improve on this willpower challenge too?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>THE SOCIAL SELF</h3>
<p>When it comes to self-control, we've seen that the human mind is not one unified self, but multiple selves who compete for control. There's the self who wants immediate gratification and the self who remembers your bigger goals. There's
  your present self, who may or may not seem to have much in common with your future self. As if that weren't a crowded enough crew, it turns out that you have a few other people living in your head too. I'm not talking about multiple
  personality disorder - I'm talking about your parents, your spouse, your children, your friends, your boss, and anyone else who is a part of your everyday world.</p>
<p>Humans are hardwired to connect with others, and our brains have adapted a nifty way to make sure we do. We have specialized brain cells - called mirror neurons - whose sole purpose is to keep track of what other people are thinking,
  feeling and doing.</p>

<h3>MIRRORING WILLPOWER FAILURES</h3>

<p>...three ways our social brains can catch willpower failures. The first is unintentional mimicry. The mirror neurons that detect another person's movement prime that very same movement in your own body. When you see me reach for the knife,
  you might unconsciously find yourself reaching out to lend me a hand. In many situations, we find ourselves automatically mirroring the physical gestures and actions of others. If you pay attention to body language, you'll notice that
  people in conversation start to adopt each other's positions. One person crosses his arms, and moments later, his conversation partner crosses her arms. She leans back, and soon enough, he leans back, too. This unconscious physical
  mirroring seems to help people understand each other better, and also creates a sense of connection and rapport. (One reason salespeople, managers and politicians are trained to intentionally mimic other people's postures is that they know
  it will make it easier to influence the person they are mirroring.)</p>
Our instinct to mimic other people's actions means that when you see someone else reach for a snack, a drink or a credit card, you may find yourself unconsciously mirroring their behaviour - and losing your willpower.</p>

<p>The second way our social brains can lead us astray is the <i>contagion of emotion</i>.</p>

<p>It's also why television sitcoms use canned laughter - they're hoping the sound of someone else cracking up will tickle your funny bone. The automatic contagion of emotions also may help explain why social network researchers Christakis
  and Fowler have found that <em>happiness and loneliness spread from friend to friend and through families</em>. How can this lead to a willpower failure? When we catch a bad feeling, we're going to turn to our usual strategies for fixing it
  - and this may mean a shopping spree or chocolate bar is in your near future.</p>

<p>Finally, our brains can even catch temptation when we see others give in. Seeing someone else engage in your willpower challenge can put you in the mood to join them. When we imagine what other people want, their wants can trigger our
  wants, and their appetites can trigger our appetites. This is one reason we eat more with others than when we're alone, why gamblers raise their bets after seeing someone else have a big win, and why we spend more when shopping with
  friends.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHO ARE YOU MIRRORING?</h3>

<p>This week, keep your eyes open for any evidence that you are mirroring other people's behaviour - especially behaviour related to your willpower challenge. Is a common indulgence the social glue that's holding a relationship together? Do
  you go overboard when others around you are doing the same?</p>


<p>What does all this mean for your self-control? The good news is, <b>goal contagion</b> is limited to goals you already, at some level, share. You can't catch a brand-new goal from a brief exposure the way you can catch a flu virus. A
  non-smoker is not going to get a nicotine craving when a friend pulls out a cigarette. But another person's behaviour can activate a goal in your mind that was not currently in charge of your choices. As we've seen, a willpower challenge
  always involves a conflict between two competing goals. You want pleasure now, but you want health later. You want to vent your anger at your boss, but you want to keep your job. You want to splurge, but you also want to get out of debt.
  Seeing another person pursue one of these competing goals can tip the balance of power in your own mind.</p>
<p>Goal contagion works in both directions - you can catch self-control as well as self-indulgence - but we seem to be especially susceptible to the contagion of temptation. If your lunch companion orders dessert, her goal for immediate
  gratification may team up with your goal for immediate gratification to outvote your goal to lose weight. Seeing someone else splurge on Christmas presents may reinforce your desire to delight your own kids on Christmas morning, and make
  you temporarily forget your goal to spend less.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: STRENGTHEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The best way to strengthen your immune response to other people's goals is to spend a few minutes at the beginning of your day thinking about your own goals, and how you could be tempted to ignore them. Like a vaccine that protects you
  from other people's germs, reflecting on your own goals will reinforce your intentions and help you avoid goal contagion.</p>

<p>Sometimes we don't catch specific goals - eat a snack, spend money, seduce a stranger - but the more general goal to follow our impulses.</p>

<p>When we observe evidence of other people ignoring rules and following their impulses, we are more likely to give in to any of our own impulses. This means that any time we see someone behaving badly, our own self-control deteriorates (bad
  news for fans of reality television, where the three rules of high ratings are: drink too much, pick a fight and sleep with someone else's boyfriend). Hearing about someone fiddling their taxes might make you feel freer to cheat on your
  diet. Seeing other drivers go over the speed limit might inspire you to go over your budget. In this way, we can catch willpower weakness from others - even if our personal weakness is very different from the giving in that we observe.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: CATCH SELF-CONTROL</h3>

<p>Research shows that thinking about someone with good self-control can increase your own willpower. Is there someone who can serve as a willpower role model for your challenge? Someone who has struggled with the same challenge and
  succeeded, or someone who exemplifies the kind of self-control you would like to have? (In my class, the most frequently nominated willpower role models are accomplished athletes, spiritual leaders and politicians, though family members and
  friends may provide even more motivation, as you'll see in a little bit.) When you need a little extra willpower, bring your role model to mind. Ask yourself: what would this willpower wonder do?</p>

<h3>WHY PEOPLE YOU LIKE ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS THAN STRANGERS</h3>

<p>Social epidemics - like the spread of obesity or smoking - follow a pattern of complex contagion. It is not enough to come into contact with a person who is a <q>carrier</q> of the behaviour. Your relationship to that person matters. In
  the Framingham community, behaviours weren't spreading over fences and across gardens. The social epidemics spread through networks of mutual respect and liking. A colleague didn't have anywhere near the effect of a close friend, and even
  the friend of a friend's friend had more influence than a person you saw every day but didn't like.</p>

<p>Social closeness matters more than geographic closeness.<br />
  Why are behaviours so contagious within close relationships? To stretch the immune system analogy a little further, we could say that our immune system only rejects the goals and behaviour of other people if it recognizes those other people
  as <q>not us</q>.</p>

<p>It turns out that when we think about people we love, respect, and feel similar to, our brains treat them more like us than like not us. You can see it in a brain scanner, watching adults think first about themselves, then about their
  mothers. The brain regions activated by self and mum are almost identical, showing that who we think we are includes the people we care about. Our sense of self depends on our relationships with others, and in many ways, we only know who we
  are by thinking about other people. Because we include other people in our sense of self, their choices influence our choices.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHO ARE YOU MOST LIKELY TO CATCH SOMETHING FROM?</h3>

<p>Take a few moments to consider who your <q>close others</q> are. Who do you spend the most time with? Who do you respect? Who do you feel most similar to? Whose opinion matters most to you? Who do you trust or care about the most? Can you
  think of any behaviours - helpful or harmful - that you've picked up from them, or that they have caught from you?</p>

<h3>ONE OF THE TRIBE</h3>
...social proof. When the rest of our tribe does something, we tend to think it's a clever thing to do. This is one of those useful survival instincts that come with having a social brain. After all, if you see your whole tribe heading east,
you'd better follow. Trusting the judgment of others is the glue that makes social living work.</p>

<p>What other people want must be good. What other people think must be true. If we don't yet have an opinion, we might as well trust the tribe.</p>

<p>Mark Ansel, the psychologist who developed this approach, argues that religious communities should take on more responsibility for supporting behaviour change. Places of worship could offer fitness classes and nutrition talks alongside
  religious services, and social events should serve healthier food. He points out that for this approach to work, religious leaders will have to be good role models. Before they start preaching morning walks, they need to get in shape
  themselves - and just as they wouldn't be caught in a brothel, they'll need to think twice about stepping into the local burger joint. After all, social proof requires proof.</p>

<p><q>One night of heavy drinking can impair your ability to think abstractly for thirty days.</q></p>

<p>a new strategy for discouraging unhealthy behaviour: just convince people it's the habit of a group they would never want to be a member of.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT!</h3>

<p>Social proof can interfere with change if we believe that everyone else does whatever behaviour we are trying to change. Do you ever tell yourself that your willpower challenge is no big deal, because it's the norm? Do you remind yourself
  of all the people you know who share the habit? If so, you may want to challenge this perception. The best way to do this is to find the people who share the behaviour you aspire to. Look for a new <q>tribe</q> you could join. It could be a
  support group, a class, a local club, an online community or even subscribing to a magazine that supports your goals. Surrounding yourself with people who share your commitment to your goals will make it feel like the norm.</p>

<p>David Desteno, a psychologist at Northeastern University, argues that social emotions like pride and shame have a quicker and more direct influence over our choices than rational arguments about long-term costs and benefits. Desteno calls
  this hot self-control. </p>

<p>When Chicago police decided to publicize the names and photos of men arrested for soliciting prostitutes, they weren't so much trying to punish the men who were caught as hoping to strike fear in the hearts of men who were thinking about
  buying sex. As Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley said in a press conference defending the policy, <q>We're telling everyone who sets foot in Chicago, if you solicit a prostitute, you will be arrested. And when you are arrested, people will
    know. Your spouse, children, friends, neighbours and employers will know.</q> Survey research of Chicago men who have paid for sex suggests that this policy works. Having their photo or name printed in the local paper was rated as the
  strongest deterrent for buying sex (87 per cent of the men interviewed said it would make them think twice). This trumped jail time, having their driver's licence suspended, and having to pay a fine of $1,000 or more.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that half of the men interviewed were not alone the first time they visited a prostitute - they were with friends or relatives. Like obesity, smoking and other social epidemics, the perception that buying sex is
  acceptable - and the behaviour itself - spreads within social networks like a contagious disease.</p>

<h3>THE LIMITS OF SHAME</h3>

<p>Before we get too excited about the power of shame, it might be wise to remember a little something called the what-the-hell effect. There is a fine line between the self-control benefits of anticipating a negative social emotion like
  shame, and the willpower-draining effects of actually feeling ashamed. We've seen again and again that feeling bad leads to giving in - especially when feeling bad takes the form of guilt and shame. As a preventive measure, shame may work.
  But once the deed is done, shame is more likely to inspire self-sabotage than self-control. For example, gamblers who feel the most ashamed following a major loss are the most likely to <q>chase</q> the lost money by gambling more and
  borrowing money to try to recoup their losses.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: THE POWER OF PRIDE</h3>

<p>Put the basic human need for approval to good use by imagining how proud you will feel when you succeed at your willpower challenge. Bring to mind someone in your tribe - a family member, friend, colleague, teacher - whose opinion matters
  to you, or who would be happy for your success. When you make a choice you're proud of, share it with your tribe.</p>

<p>As Deb Lemire, president of the Association for Size Diversity and Health, says, <q>If shame worked, there'd be no fat people.</q></p>

<p>Research shows that being kicked out of the tribe drains willpower.</p>

<p>Studies show that the more racial minorities are exposed to prejudice, the less self-control they have - and just reminding minorities of discrimination depletes their willpower. Any time we feel excluded or disrespected, we are at greater
  risk for giving in to our worst impulses.
  Rather than shame people for their willpower failures, we would do far better by offering social support for willpower successes. One good example is a weight-loss intervention at the University of Pittsburgh that requires people to enroll
  with a friend or family member. The participants are given <q>support homework</q>, such as sharing a healthy meal during the week and calling to make contact and encourage each other.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: MAKE IT A GROUP PROJECT</h3>

<p>You don't have to conquer your willpower challenge alone. Is there a friend, family member or colleague who could join you in your willpower goals? You don't have to have the same goals; just keeping in touch and encouraging each other can
  provide a boost of social support to your self-control. If you like your social support with a touch of competition, enlist others in a willpower face-off. Who will be the first to finish a task they've been putting off, or the person to
  save the most money in one month?</p>

<h3>E-MAIL CHECK-INS KEEP A GOAL ALIVE</h3>
<p>In that final class, some students were concerned that once the course was over, they'd lose the motivation to keep up with the changes they had implemented. There is a big social component to the class, and knowing they can share their
  experiences - even just with the person sitting next to them - motivates many to have something to report.</p>
<p>So at the last class, as some students were getting anxious, I told everyone to exchange e-mail addresses with someone they didn't know. Then I said, <q>Tell this person what you are going to do in the next week that is consistent with
    your goals.</q> Their assignment was to e-mail their partner and ask them <q>Did you do what you said you were going to do?</q></p>
<p>The student who e-mailed me months later said that the sole thing that kept her going that first week after the class ended was knowing she was going to have to tell this stranger whether or not she had kept her word. But then it turned
  into a true support system. They kept the weekly check-ins going for some time, despite the fact that they had no relationship outside the class. By the time they stopped, the changes were a part of her life, and she no longer needed the
  extra accountability and support.</p>

<h3>Don't Read This Chapter: The Limits of <q>I Won't</q> Power</h3>

<p>Ironic rebound explains many modern frustrations: the insomniac who finds herself more wide-awake the harder she tries to fall asleep; the dieter who banishes carbohydrates, only to find himself dreaming about pasta and shortbread; the
  worrier who tries to block out her anxiety but gets drawn again and again into disaster fantasies. Wegner has even shown that suppressing thoughts about a crush while you are awake increases the likelihood of dreaming about them - more than
  intentionally fantasizing about the dreamboat does. This, no doubt, contributes to the Romeo and Juliet effect - the well-known psychological tendency to fall deeper in desire whenever a romance is forbidden.</p>

<p>Trying not to think about something guarantees that it is never far from your mind. This leads to a second problem: when you try to push a thought away and it keeps coming back to your mind, you are more likely to assume that it must be
  true. Why else would the thought keep resurfacing? We trust that our thoughts are important sources of information. When a thought becomes more frequent and harder to pull yourself away from, you will naturally assume that it is an urgent
  message that you should pay attention to.</p>

<p>Whatever fear or desire you try to push away will become more convincing and compelling.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: INVESTIGATING IRONIC REBOUND</h3>

<p>Is there something you try to keep out of your mind? If so, examine the theory of ironic rebound. Does suppression work? Or does trying to push something out of your mind make it come back stronger?</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: INVESTIGATING IRONIC REBOUND</h3>

<p>Is there something you try to keep out of your mind? If so, examine the theory of ironic rebound. Does suppression work? Or does trying to push something out of your mind make it come back stronger? (Yes, you are going to give the monitor
  the job of monitoring the monitor.)</p>

<h3>AVOIDING IRONIC REBOUND</h3>

<p>How can you find your way out of this confounding dilemma? Wegner suggests an antidote to ironic rebound that is, itself, ironic: give up. When you stop trying to control unwanted thoughts and emotions, they stop controlling you. Studies
  of brain activation confirm that as soon as you give participants permission to express a thought they were trying to suppress, that thought becomes less primed and less likely to intrude into conscious awareness. Paradoxically, permission
  to think a thought reduces the likelihood of thinking it.</p>
The willingness to think what you think and feel what you feel - without necessarily believing that it is true, and without feeling compelled to act on it - is an effective strategy for treating anxiety, depression, food cravings and
addiction. As we consider the evidence for each, we'll see that giving up control of our inner experiences gives us greater control over our outer actions.</p>

<p>The more depressed people try to block out distressing thoughts, the more depressed they get.</p>

<p>Trying to suppress anxiety also backfires. For example, people who try not to think about a painful medical procedure end up feeling more anxious and have more intrusive thoughts about the pain. People who try to suppress their fear before
  giving a public speech not only feel more anxious, but also have higher heart rates (and are therefore more likely to blow the big talk).</p>

<p>Goldin takes a very different approach. He teaches social anxiety sufferers to observe and accept their thoughts and feelings - even the scary ones. The goal is not to get rid of the anxiety and self-doubt, but to develop a trust that they
  can handle these difficult thoughts and feelings. <em>If they learn that there is no inner experience that they need to protect themselves from, they can find more freedom in the outer world.</em> When a worry comes up, he instructs the
  anxiety sufferers to notice what they are thinking, feel the anxiety in their body, and then turn their attention to their breathing. If the anxiety persists, he encourages them to imagine their thoughts and emotions dissolving with the
  breath. He teaches them that if they don't fight the anxiety, it will naturally run its course.</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL, BUT DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU THINK</h3>

<p>When an upsetting thought comes to mind, try the technique that Goldin teaches his subjects. Instead of instantly trying to distract yourself from it, let yourself notice the thought. Often, our most disturbing thoughts are familiar - the
  same worry, the same self-criticism, the same memory. <q>What if something goes wrong?</q> <q>I can't believe I did that. I'm so stupid.</q> <q>If only that hadn't happened. What could I have done differently?</q> These thoughts pop up like
  a song that gets stuck in our heads, seemingly out of nowhere, but then is impossible to get rid of. Let yourself notice whether the upsetting thought is an old, familiar tune - that's your first clue that it is not critically important
  information you need to believe. Then shift your attention to what you are feeling in your body. Notice if there is any tension present, or changes to your heart rate or breathing. Notice if you feel it in your gut, your chest, your throat,
  or anywhere else in your body. Once you've observed the thought and feelings, shift your attention to your breathing. Notice how it feels to breathe in and breathe out. Sometimes the upsetting thought and feelings naturally dissipate when
  you do this. Other times, they will keep interrupting your attention to your breath. If this happens, imagine the thought and feelings as clouds passing through your mind and body. Keep breathing, and imagine the clouds dissolving or
  floating by. Imagine your breath as a wind that dissolves and moves the clouds effortlessly. You don't need to make the thought go away; just stay with the feeling of your breath.</p>
<p>Notice that this technique is not the same thing as believing or ruminating over a thought. The opposite of thought suppression is accepting the presence of the thought - not believing it. You're accepting that thoughts come and go, and
  that you can't always control what thoughts come to mind. You don't have to automatically accept the content of the thought. In other words, you might say to yourself, <q>Oh well, there's that thought again - worries happen. That's just the
    way the mind works, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything.</q> </p>

<p>After trying this technique a few times, compare it with the results you get from trying to push away upsetting thoughts and emotions. Which is more effective at giving you peace of mind?</p>

<p>Valerie was even able to bring that same willingness to her visits with her mother, letting herself feel her frustration instead of telling herself she wasn't allowed to be angry with her mother. It didn't change the situation, but it took
  away some of the stress. When she wasn't trying to get rid of her feelings, she was better able to take care of both her mother and herself.</p>

<p>A 2010 survey found that dieters are much more likely than non-dieters to try to suppress thoughts about food. And - as Wegner's white bears would predict - dieters who suppress thoughts about food have the least control around food. They
  experience more intense food cravings and are more likely to binge-eat than those who do not try to control their thoughts.</p>

<p>In fact, dieting is a better way to gain weight than to lose it. People who go on diets gain more weight over time than people who start at the same weight but never diet.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: WHAT'S ON YOUR MOST-WANTED LIST?</h3>

<p>The science suggests that when we outlaw a food, we increase desire. Is this true in your experience? Have you ever tried to lose weight by cutting out a food group or favourite snack? If so, how long did that last - and how did it end? Is
  there anything on your do-not-eat list right now? If so, how has outlawing it influenced your cravings for it? If you don't diet, is there anything you're prohibiting? Has it killed your desire, or fed it?</p>

<p>Other students got a lesson in the white-bear phenomenon. Experimenters explained ironic rebound and encouraged the students not to push away thoughts about eating chocolate. Instead, they should notice when they were craving chocolate,
  accept whatever thoughts or feelings they had about the chocolate, but also remember that they didn't have to act on those thoughts and feelings. While not controlling their thoughts, they still had to control their behaviour.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: ACCEPT THOSE CRAVINGS - JUST DON'T ACT ON THEM</h3>

  <p>In the Hershey's Kisses study, students who learned about the white-bear rebound effect were given the following four-step advice for handling their cravings. This week, try applying this advice to your own most challenging cravings, be
    they chocolate, cappuccinos or checking e-mail.</p>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li>Notice that you are thinking about your temptation or feeling a craving.</li>
    <li>Accept the thought or feeling without trying to immediately distract yourself or argue with it. Remind yourself of the white-bear rebound effect.</li>
    <li>Step back by realizing that thoughts and feelings aren't always under your control, but you can choose whether to act on them.</li>
    <li>Remember your goal. Remind yourself of whatever your commitment is, as the students reminded themselves of their agreement not to eat the Hershey's Kisses.</li>

<h3>THE NO-DIETING DIET</h3>

<p>Researchers at Laval University in Quebec have been studying a unique intervention that focuses on what participants should eat. The programme doesn't hand out a list of forbidden foods, and it doesn't focus on cutting calories. Instead,
  it emphasizes how foods can create health and provide pleasure. It also asks participants to think about what they can do to improve their health - such as exercise - instead of thinking in terms of what they shouldn't do or eat.</p>
<p>In essence, the programme turns an <q>I won't</q> power challenge into an <q>I will</q> power challenge. Instead of waging war against their appetites, they make it their mission to pursue health.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: TURN YOUR <q>I WON'T</q> INTO <q>I WILL</q></h3>

  <p>For your biggest <q>I won't</q> power challenge, try one of the following strategies for switching your focus:</p>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li>What could you do instead of the <q>I won't</q> behaviour that might satisfy the same needs? Most bad habits are an attempt to meet a need, whether it's reducing stress, having fun or seeking approval. You can shift the focus away
      from prohibiting your bad habit by replacing it with a new (hopefully, healthier) habit. One of my students was trying to give up coffee and turned to tea as a substitute. It had all the same benefits - being a good excuse for a break,
      giving him more energy, easy to get anywhere - without as much caffeine.</li>
    <li>If you weren't doing the bad habit, what might you be doing instead? Most of our addictions and distractions take time and energy away from something else we could be doing. Sometimes focusing on that missed opportunity is more
      motivating than trying to give up the bad habit. One of my students felt she was wasting her time getting sucked into reality television shows. She had more success at turning off the TV when she set a goal for what she should use the
      time for instead - learning to be a better cook.</li>
    <li>Can you redefine the <q>I won't</q> challenge so that it becomes an <q>I will</q> challenge? Sometimes the very same behaviour can be thought of in two different ways. For example, one of my students redefined <q>not being late</q> as
      <q>being the first person there</q> or <q>arriving five minutes early</q>. This may not sound like much of a difference, but he found himself far more motivated - and less likely to be late - when he turned being on time into a race he
      could win. If you focus on what you want to do, instead of what you don't want to do, you sidestep the dangers of ironic rebound.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>...technique called <q>surfing the urge</q>. They were instructed to pay close attention to the urge to smoke, without trying to change it or get rid of it - an approach that we've seen can be quite helpful for dealing with worries and
  food cravings. Instead of distracting themselves from the urge or hoping that it would just go away, they should really get a good look at it. What thoughts were going through their mind? What did the urge feel like in the body? Was there
  nausea, or a gnawing in their stomach? Did they feel tension in their lungs or throat? Bowen explained to the smokers that urges always pass eventually, whether or not you give in to them. When they felt a strong craving, they should
  imagine the urge as a wave in the ocean. It would build in intensity, but ultimately crash and dissolve. The smokers were to picture themselves riding the wave, not fighting it but also not giving in to it.</p>

<p>This is one of the best side effects of surfing the urge: you learn how to accept and handle all your difficult inner experiences, and no longer need to turn to unhealthy rewards for comfort.</p>

<div class="important">
  <h3>WILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: SURF THE URGE</h3>

  <p>When an urge takes hold, stay with the physical sensations and ride them like a wave, neither pushing them away nor acting on them.</p>

  <p>When the urge takes hold, pause for a moment to sense your body. What does the urge feel like? Is it hot or cold? Do you feel tension anywhere in your body? What's happening with your heart rate, your breathing, or your gut? Stay with
    the sensations for at least one minute. Notice whether the feelings fluctuate in intensity or quality. Not acting on an urge can sometimes increase its intensity - like an attention-seeking child throwing a temper tantrum. See if you can
    stay with these sensations without trying to push them away, and without acting on them. As you practise surfing the urge, the breath can be a wonderful source of support. You can surf the sensations of breathing - noticing how it feels
    to inhale and exhale - alongside the sensations of the urge.
  <p>When you first practise this strategy, you may surf the urge and still give in. ... Don't use your first few attempts as a final verdict on the value of this approach. Surfing the urge is a skill that builds with time, like any new form
    of self-control.</p>
</div>

<h3>SURFING THE URGE TO COMPLAIN</h3>

<p>Therese knew that her habit of constantly criticizing her husband was putting a strain on their relationship. They had been married for five years, but the last year had been especially tense. They argued frequently about how things should
  be done around the house and how to discipline their four-year-old son. Therese couldn't help but feel that her husband was going out of his way to irritate her by doing things the wrong way. In turn, he was tired of always being corrected
  and never being thanked. Even though Therese wanted him to change his behaviour, she realized that it was her behaviour that was threatening their marriage.</p>
<p>She decided to try surfing the urge to criticize. When she felt the impulse rising, she paused and felt the tension in her body. It was strongest in her jaw, face and chest. She watched the sensations of irritation and frustration. They
  felt like heat and pressure building. It was as if she had to say the criticism to get it out of her system, like a volcano that needed to erupt. She had been acting on the belief that she had to get the complaint out of her, that she had
  to express it or it would fester inside her. Therese tested the idea that, like cravings, the impulse would actually pass on its own even if she didn't act on it. When Therese surfed the urge, she let herself say the complaint internally.
  Sometimes she saw it as ridiculous, and sometimes it felt really true. Either way, she let it be in her mind without arguing and without expressing it. Then she imagined her irritation as a wave and rode out the feelings. She found that the
  impulse would subside if she breathed and stayed with the feeling in her body.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>...we've seen again and again that we are not one self, but multiple selves. Our human nature includes both the self that wants immediate gratification, and the self with a higher purpose. We are born to be tempted, and born to resist. It
  is just as human to feel stressed, scared, and out of control as it is to find the strength to be calm and in charge of our choices. Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing
  who we are. In the quest for self-control, the usual weapons we wield against ourselves - guilt, stress and shame - don't work. People who have the greatest self-control aren't waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate
  these competing selves.</p>
<p>If there is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to one thing: the power of paying attention. It's training the mind to recognize when you're making a choice, rather than running on autopilot. It's noticing how you give
  yourself permission to procrastinate, or how you use good behaviour to justify self-indulgence. It's realizing that the promise of reward doesn't always deliver, and that your future self is not a superhero or a stranger. It's seeing what
  in your world - from sales gimmicks to social proof - is shaping your behaviour. It's staying put and sensing a craving when you'd rather distract yourself or give in. It's remembering what you really want, and knowing what really makes you
  feel better. Self-awareness is the one <q>self</q> you can always count on to help you do what is difficult, and what matters most.</p>

<p>...a scientist friend of mine suggested that the only reasonable conclusion to a book about scientific ideas is: Draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>As you move forward, keep the mindset of a scientist. Try new things, collect your own data, and listen to the evidence. Stay open to surprising ideas, and learn from both your failures and your successes. Keep what works, and share what
  you know with others.</p>
