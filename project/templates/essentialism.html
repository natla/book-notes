  <p>THE WISDOM OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE ELIMINATION OF NON-ESSENTIALS.</p>
  <p class="author">Lin Yutang</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many times have you reacted to a request by saying yes without really thinking about it? How many times have you resented committing to do something and wondered, &ldquo;Why did I sign up for this?&rdquo; How often do you say yes simply to
  please? Or to avoid trouble? Or because &ldquo;yes&rdquo; had just become your default response?
  <br>
  Now let me ask you this: Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin? Have you ever felt both overworked <i>and</i> underutilized? Have you ever found yourself majoring in minor activities? Do you ever feel busy but not productive? Like
  you&rsquo;re always in motion, but never getting anywhere?
  <br>
  If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the way of the Essentialist.
</p>

<p> <i>Weniger aber besser. Less but better.</i></p>

<p>The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better.
  <br>It means pursuing it in a <i>disciplined</i> way.
  <br>The way of the Essentialist isn&rsquo;t about setting New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; more, or about pruning your in-box, or about mastering some new strategy in time management. It is about pausing constantly to ask,
  &ldquo;Am I investing in the right activities?&rdquo; There are far more activities and opportunities in the world than we have time and resources to invest in. And although many of them may be good, or even very good, the fact is that most are
  trivial and few are vital. The way of the Essentialist involves learning to tell the difference&mdash;learning to filter through all those options and selecting only those that are truly essential.
  <br>Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it&rsquo;s about how to get the <i>right</i> things done. It doesn&rsquo;t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time
  and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.
</p>

<p>[when] the energy is divided into many different activities. The result is that we have the unfulfilling experience of making a millimeter of progress in a million directions. [when] the energy is given to fewer activities. The result is that by
  investing in fewer things we have the satisfying experience of making significant progress in the things that matter most.</p>

<p>The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so
  the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.</p>

<strong>If you don&rsquo;t prioritize your life, someone else will.</strong>

<p>&ldquo;Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution toward my goal?&rdquo;</p>

<em>What if schools eliminated busywork and replaced it with important projects that made a difference to the whole community? What if all students had time to think about their highest contribution to their future so that when they left high school
  they were not just starting on the race to nowhere?</em>

<h3>ESSENCE <br>What Is the Core Mindset of an Essentialist?</h3>

<br>
<h4>CHOOSE</h4>

<p><em>...while we may not always have control over our options, we <i>always</i> have control over how we choose among them.</em></p>

<p>For too long, we have overemphasized the external aspect of choices (our options) and underemphasized our internal ability to choose (our actions). This is more than semantics. Think about it this way. <em>Options (things) can be taken away, while
    our core ability to choose (free will) cannot be.</em></p>

<p>when we surrender our right to choose, we give others not just the power but also the explicit permission to choose for us.</p>

<br>
<h4>DISCERN<br>The Unimportance of Practically Everything</h4>

<p>Distinguishing the &ldquo;trivial many&rdquo; from the &ldquo;vital few&rdquo; can be applied to every kind of human endeavor large or small and has been done so persuasively by Richard Koch, author of several books on how to apply the Pareto
  Principle (80/20 Rule) to everyday life.</p>

<p>Some believe the relationship between efforts and results is even less linear, following what scientists call a &ldquo;power law.&rdquo; According to the power law theory, certain efforts actually produce exponentially more results than others.
  For example, as Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer for Microsoft, has said (and then confirmed to me in person), <em>&ldquo;The top software developers are more productive than average software developers not by a factor of 10X or
    100X or even 1,000X but by 10,000X.&rdquo;</em> It may be an exaggeration, but it still makes the point that <i>certain</i> efforts produce exponentially better results than others.
  <br>The overwhelming reality is: <em>we live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.</em> As John Maxwell has written, &ldquo;You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically
  everything.&rdquo;9
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

  <img class="detail-img inlined" src="images/essentialism/essentialist.png" alt="An Essentialist thinks almost everything is nonessential." />
</p>

<p>We discover how even <em>the many good opportunities we pursue are often far less valuable than the few truly great ones. Once we understand this, we start scanning our environment for those vital few and eagerly eliminate the trivial many.</em>
</p>

<p>To practice this Essentialist skill we can start at a simple level, and once it becomes second nature for everyday decisions we can begin to apply it to bigger and broader areas of our personal and professional lives.</p>

<br>
<h4>TRADE-OFF<br>Which problem do I want?</h4>

<p>The reality is, saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others.</p>

<p>It is easy to see why it&rsquo;s so tempting to deny the reality of trade-offs. After all, by definition, a trade-off involves two things we want. Do you want more pay or more vacation time? Do you want to finish this next e-mail or be on time to
  your meeting? Do you want it done faster or better? Obviously, when faced with the choice between two things we want, the preferred answer is <i>yes</i> to both. But as much as we&rsquo;d like to, we simply cannot have it all.</p>

<p>A Nonessentialist approaches every trade-off by asking, &ldquo;How can I do both?&rdquo; <em>Essentialists ask the tougher but ultimately more liberating question, &ldquo;Which problem do I want?&rdquo; An Essentialist makes trade-offs
    deliberately.</em></p>

<p>As painful as they can sometimes be, trade-offs represent a significant opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome <i>we</i> want.
</p>

<h3>EXPLORE<br>Discern the Vital Few from the Trivial Many</h3>

<p>One paradox of Essentialism is that Essentialists actually explore <i>more</i> options than their Nonessentialist counterparts. Nonessentialists get excited by virtually everything and thus react to everything. But because they are so busy
  pursuing every opportunity and idea they actually explore less. The way of the Essentialist, on the other hand, is to <em>explore and evaluate a broad set of options <b>before</b> committing to any.</em> Because Essentialists will commit and
  &ldquo;go big&rdquo; on only the vital few ideas or activities, they <em>explore more options at first to ensure they pick the right one later.</em></p>

<br>
<h4>ESCAPE<br>The Perks of Being Unavailable</h4>

<p><strong>Space to Design</strong></p>

<p>The value of creating space to explore has been emphasized for me in my work with the d.school at Stanford (officially the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford). The first thing I noticed when I walked into the room where I had been
  asked to teach a course was the lack of traditional chairs. Instead there are foam cubes you can sit on&mdash;rather uncomfortably, as I soon discovered. Like almost everything at the d.school, this is done by design. In this case the cubes are
  there so that after a few minutes of uncomfortable perching students would <i>rather</i> stand up, walk around, and engage with one another&mdash;not just the classmates sitting to their right or to their left. And that is the point. The school has
  used the physical space to encourage new ways of engaging and thinking.</p>

<p>To that end, the school has also created a hiding place called &ldquo;Booth Noir.&rdquo; This is a small room deliberately designed to fit only one to three people. It is windowless, soundproof, and deliberately free of distraction. It is,
  according to Scott Doorley and Scott Witthoft in their book <i>Make Space</i>, &ldquo;beyond low-tech. It&rsquo;s no tech.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s tucked away on the ground floor. It is not, as Doorley and Witthoft point out, on the way to anywhere else.
  The only reason you go there is to think. By creating space to think and focus, students can step back to see more clearly.</p>

<p>When I say <i>focus</i>, I don&rsquo;t mean simply picking a question or possibility and thinking about it obsessively. I mean creating the space to explore one hundred questions and possibilities. An Essentialist focuses the way our eyes focus;
  not by fixating on something but by constantly adjusting and adapting to the field of vision.</p>

<p>On a recent meeting back at the d.school (in another room with no seats or desks but with whiteboards from floor to ceiling covered with Post-its of every fathomable color), I met with Jeremy Utley. He is my partner in developing a new prototyped
  class that, in a moment of genius, Jeremy dubbed &ldquo;Designing Life, Essentially.&rdquo;
  <br><em>The sole purpose of the class is to create space for students to design their lives. Each week it gives them a scheduled excuse to think. They are forced to turn off their laptops and smartphones and instead to turn on the full power of
    their minds.</em> They are given assignments to practice deliberately discerning the essential few from the many good.
</p>

<p>Inspired by Newton, I took a similar, if perhaps less extreme, approach to writing this book. I blocked off eight hours a day to write: from 5:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M., five days a week. The basic rule was no e-mail, no calls, no appointments, and no
  interruptions until after 1:00 P.M. I didn&rsquo;t always achieve it, but the discipline made a big difference. I set my e-mail bounceback to explain that I was in &ldquo;monk mode&rdquo; until after the book was complete. It is difficult to
  overstate how much freedom I found in this approach.</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m talking about deliberately setting aside distraction-free time in a distraction-free space to do absolutely nothing other than think.</em></p>

<br>
<h4>LOOK<br>See What Really Matters</h4>

<p>Have you ever felt lost and unsure about what to focus on? Have you ever felt overwhelmed by all of the information bombarding you and not sure what to make of it? Have you ever felt dizzy from the different requests coming at you and unable to
  figure out which are important and which are not? Have you ever missed the point to something in your work or at home and not realized your mistake until it was too late?</p>

<p>Being a journalist of your own life will force you to stop hyper-focusing on all the minor details and see the bigger picture. You can apply the skills of a journalist no matter what field you are in&mdash;you can even apply them to your
  personal life. By training yourself to look for &ldquo;the lead,&rdquo; you will suddenly find yourself able to see what you have missed. You&rsquo;ll be able to do more than simply see the dots of each day: you&rsquo;ll also connect them to see
  the trends. Instead of just reacting to the facts, you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on the larger issues that really matter.</p>

<p>Essentialists are powerful observers and listeners. Knowing that the reality of trade-offs means they can&rsquo;t possibly pay attention to everything, they listen deliberately for what is not being explicitly stated. They read between the lines.

<h4>PLAY<br>Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child</h4>

<p>Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to germinate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light.</p>

<p>First, play broadens the range of options available to us. It helps us to see possibilities we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have seen and make connections we would otherwise not have made. It opens our minds and broadens our perspective.</p>

<p>Second, play is an antidote to stress.</p>

<p>Third, &#8230; play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain.</p>

<p>Play stimulates the parts of the brain involved in both careful, logical reasoning <i>and</i> carefree, unbound exploration.</p>

<br>
<h4>SLEEP<br>Protecting the Asset</h4>

<p><em>The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is <i>ourselves.</i> If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest
    contribution.</em></p>

<p>Well, while there are clearly people who can survive on fewer hours of sleep, I&rsquo;ve found that most of them are just so used to being tired they have forgotten what it really feels like to be fully rested.</p>

<p>the <i>second</i> most important factor differentiating the best violinists from the good violinists was actually <i>sleep</i>. The best violinists slept an average of 8.6 hours in every twenty-four-hour period: about an hour longer than the
  average
  American. Over the period of a week they also spent an average of 2.8 hours of napping in the afternoon: about two hours longer than the average. Sleep, the authors of the study concluded, allowed these top performers to regenerate so that they
  could practice with greater concentration. So yes, while they practiced more, they <i>also got more out of those hours of practice</i> because they were better rested.</p>

<p>sleep deprivation undermines high performance. He likens sleep deficit to drinking too much alcohol, explaining that pulling an all-nighter (i.e., going twenty-four hours without sleep) or having a week of sleeping just four or five hours a
  night actually &ldquo;induces an impairment equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.1%.</p>

<p>The researchers explained that <em>while we sleep our brains are hard at work encoding and restructuring information. Therefore, when we wake up, our brains may have made new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to
    problems, literally overnight.</em></p>

<p>In a nutshell, <strong>sleep is what allows us to operate at our highest level of contribution so that we can achieve more, in less time.</strong></p>

<br>
<h4>SELECT<br>The Power of Extreme Criteria</h4>

<br>
<strong>The 90 Percent Rule</strong>

<p>you can apply [it] to just about every decision or dilemma. As you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than
  90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. This way you avoid getting caught up in indecision, or worse, getting stuck with the 60s or 70s. Think about how you&rsquo;d feel if you scored a 65 on some test. Why
  would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life?</p>

<p><em>sometimes you will have to turn down a seemingly very good option and have faith that the perfect option will soon come along.</em> Sometimes it will, and sometimes it won&rsquo;t, but the point is that the very act of applying selective
  criteria
  forces <em><i>you</i> to choose which perfect option to wait for, rather than letting other people, or the universe, choose for you.</em> Like any Essentialist skill, it forces you to make decisions by design, rather than default.</p>

<p>when our selection criteria are too broad, we will find ourselves committing to too many options. What&rsquo;s more, assigning simple numerical values to our options forces us to make decisions consciously, logically, and rationally, rather than
  impulsively or emotionally.</p>

<p>Nonessentialists apply implicit or unspoken criteria to the decisions they make in both their personal and their professional lives. For example, when deciding what projects to take on at work, a Nonessentialist may operate by the implicit
  criterion, &ldquo;If my manager asks me to do it, then I should do it.&rdquo; Or even more broadly, &ldquo;If someone asks me to do something, I should try to do it.&rdquo; Or still more broadly, &ldquo;If other people in the company are doing
  it, I should be doing it.&rdquo; <strong>In an era of social media where we are vastly more aware of what other people are doing, this criterion can create a particularly serious burden by amplifying all of the nonessential activities we
    &ldquo;should&rdquo; be doing.</strong></p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>Nonessentialist</th>
      <th>Essentialist</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Says yes to almost every request or opportunity</td>
      <td>Says yes to only the top 10 percent of opportunities</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Uses broad, implicit criteria like<br>&ldquo;If someone I know is doing it, I should do it.&rdquo;</td>
      <td>Uses narrow, explicit criteria like<br>&ldquo;Is this <i>exactly</i> what I am looking for?&rdquo;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>If it isn&rsquo;t a clear <i>yes</i>, then it&rsquo;s a clear <i>no</i>.</strong></p>

<p>Vitsoe&rsquo;s approach to hiring may be more selective still.
  <br>They begin with the basic assumption that they would rather be understaffed than hire the wrong person quickly. Accordingly, when they are looking for a new employee, they have a rigorous and systematic selection process. First, they interview
  someone by phone. This is deliberate because they want to strip away all visual cues while forming their first impression... They weed out many at this stage&mdash;in a time-efficient manner.
  <br>Second, a candidate is interviewed by multiple people throughout the company. If a candidate makes it through several interviews, he or she is invited to spend a day working with the team. Then management sends a questionnaire out to the whole
  team asking them how they feel about the candidate. But instead of just the obvious questions, they ask, &ldquo;Would he or she <i>love</i> working here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Would we <i>love</i> having him or her work with us?&rdquo; No offer is made
  at this point, and no commitment is implied on the part of the candidate. The objective is to allow both sides to see each other as honestly as possible. If the fit is just right, the candidate will continue through the final interviews and
  may receive an offer. If the team isn&rsquo;t absolutely sure, then the answer is no.
</p>

<p>Their primary criterion is, &ldquo;Will this person be an absolutely <i>natural</i> fit?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Opportunity Knocks</strong></p>

<p>Being selective when deciding what opportunities to go after is one thing, but it can get even harder when opportunities come to us. We get a job offer we didn&rsquo;t expect. A side project comes along that isn&rsquo;t really what we do, but it
  is easy cash. Someone asks us to help out with something we love doing, but it is unpaid work. An acquaintance has a time share available in a less-than-ideal location but at a discounted rate. What do we do?</p>

<p>The fear of missing out goes into full effect. How can we say no; the offer is right here for the taking. We might never have gone after it, but now it is so easy to get it we consider it. But if we just say yes because it is an easy reward, we
  run the risk of having to later say no to a more meaningful one.</p>

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s a simple, systematic process you can use to apply selective criteria to opportunities that come your way. First, write down the opportunity. Second, write down a list of three &ldquo;minimum criteria&rdquo; the options would need
    to
    &ldquo;pass&rdquo; in order to be considered. Third, write down a list of three ideal or &ldquo;extreme criteria&rdquo; the options would need to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; in order to be considered. By definition, if the opportunity doesn&rsquo;t pass
    the
    first set of criteria, the answer is obviously no. But if it also doesn't pass <i>two of your three</i> extreme criteria, the answer is still no.</em></p>

<p>Applying tougher criteria to life&rsquo;s big decisions allows us to better tap into our brain&rsquo;s sophisticated search engine. Think of it as the difference between conducting a Google search for &ldquo;good restaurant in New York
  City&rdquo; and &ldquo;best slice of pizza in downtown Brooklyn.&rdquo; If we search for &ldquo;a good career opportunity,&rdquo; our brain will serve up scores of pages to explore and work through. Instead, <em>why not conduct an advanced search
    and
    ask three questions: &ldquo;What am I deeply passionate about?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What taps my talent?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What meets a significant need in the world?&rdquo; Naturally there won&rsquo;t be as many pages to view, but that is the point
    of the exercise.</em> We aren&rsquo;t looking for a plethora of good things to do. We are looking for the <i>one</i> where we can make our absolutely highest point of contribution.</p>

<h3>ELIMINATE<br>How Can We Cut Out the Trivial Many?</h3>

<br>
<h4>CLARIFY<br>One Decision That Makes a Thousand</h4>

<p>When we are unclear about our real purpose in life&mdash;in other words, when we don&rsquo;t have a clear sense of our goals, our aspirations, and our values&mdash;we make up our own social games. We waste time and energies on trying to look
  good in comparison to other people. We overvalue nonessentials like a nicer car or house, or even intangibles like the number of our followers on Twitter or the way we look in our Facebook photos. As a result, we neglect activities that <i>are
  </i> truly essential, like spending time with our loved ones, or nurturing our spirit, or taking care of our health.</p>

<p>when individuals are involved in too many disparate activities&mdash;even good activities&mdash;they can fail to achieve their essential mission. One reason for this is that the activities don&rsquo;t work in concert, so they don&rsquo;t add up
  into a meaningful whole. For example, pursuing five different majors, each of them perfectly good, does not equal a degree. Likewise, five different jobs in five different industries do not add up to a forward-moving career. Without clarity and
  purpose, pursuing something because it is good is not good enough to make a high level of contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Intent</strong></p>

<p>An essential intent &#8230; is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions. It&rsquo;s like deciding you&rsquo;re going to become a
  doctor instead of a lawyer. <em>One strategic choice eliminates a universe of other options and maps a course for the next five, ten, or even twenty years of your life.</em></p>

<p><strong>STOP WORDSMITHING AND START DECIDING</strong></p>

<p>When developing statements of purpose&mdash;for your company, your team, or even yourself&mdash;there is a tendency to start obsessing about trivial stylistic details, like &ldquo;Should we use this word or that word?&rdquo; But this makes it all
  too easy to slip into meaningless clich&eacute;s and buzzwords that lead to vague, meaningless statements... An essential intent doesn&rsquo;t have to be elegantly crafted; it&rsquo;s the
  substance, not the style that counts. Instead, ask the more essential question that will inform every future decision you will ever make: &ldquo;If we could be truly excellent at only one thing, what would it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>ASK, &ldquo;HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN WE&rsquo;RE DONE?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>When I took his course as a graduate student, one of the assignments he gave us was to evaluate the vision and mission statements of nonprofit organizations.
  <br>As the class reviewed more than one hundred examples, they noticed that some of the most grandiose were actually the <i>least</i> inspiring. For example, one had the mission to &ldquo;eliminate hunger in the world,&rdquo; but given that there
  were
  just five people in the organization, the mission felt like little more than empty words. Then out of the cluttered landscape of such loose idealism came a statement we all immediately understood and were inspired by. It was from a slightly
  unexpected place: the actor/social entrepreneur Brad Pitt, who, appalled by the lack of progress in rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, had started an organization called &ldquo;Make It Right&rdquo; with the essential intent
  &ldquo;to build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families living in the Lower 9th Ward.&rdquo; That statement took the air out of the room. The concreteness of the objective made it real. The realness made it inspiring. It
  answered the question: &ldquo;How will we know when we have succeeded?&rdquo;
</p>

<br>
<h4>DARE<br>The Power of a Graceful &ldquo;No&rdquo;</h4>

<p>Have you ever felt a tension between what you felt was right and what someone was pressuring you to do? Have you ever felt the conflict between your internal conviction and an external action? Have you ever said yes when you meant no simply to
  avoid conflict or friction? Have you ever felt too scared or timid to turn down an invitation or request from a boss, colleague, friend, neighbor, or family member for fear of disappointing them? If you have, you&rsquo;re not alone. Navigating
  these moments with courage and grace is one of the most important skills to master in becoming an Essentialist&mdash;and one of the hardest.</p>

<p>A second reason why it is hard to choose what is essential in the moment is as simple as an innate fear of social awkwardness. The fact is, we as humans are wired to want to get along with others. After all, thousands of years ago when we all
  lived in tribes of hunter gatherers, our survival depended on it. And while conforming to what people in a group expect of us&mdash;what psychologists call normative conformity&mdash;is no longer a matter of life and death, the desire is still
  deeply ingrained in us. This is why, whether it&rsquo;s an old friend who invites you to dinner or a boss who asks you to take on an important and high-profile project, or a neighbor who begs you to help with the PTA bake sale, the very thought
  of saying no literally brings us physical discomfort. We feel guilty. We don&rsquo;t want to let someone down. We are worried about damaging the relationship. But these emotions muddle our clarity. They distract us from the reality of the fact
  that <strong>either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years.</strong></p>

<p>The only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully. Because once we do, we find, not only that our fears of disappointing or angering others were exaggerated, but that <em>people actually respect us
    <i>more</i>.</em>
  Since becoming an Essentialist I have found it almost universally true that people respect and admire those with the courage of conviction to say no.</p>

<p>Nonessentialists say yes because of feelings of social awkwardness and pressure. They say yes automatically, without thinking, <em>often in pursuit of the rush one gets from having pleased someone.</em> But Essentialists know that after the rush
  comes the
  pang of regret. They know they will soon feel bullied and resentful&mdash;both at the other person and at themselves. Eventually they will wake up to the unpleasant reality that <em>something more important must now be sacrificed to accommodate
    this
    new commitment.</em></p>

<p>denying the request is not the same as denying the <i>person</i>.</p>

<p>Essentialists <i>choose</i> &ldquo;no&rdquo; more often than they <i>say</i> no. There may be a time when the most graceful way to say no is to simply say a blunt no. But whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;I am flattered that you thought of me but
  I&rsquo;m
  afraid I don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would very much like to but I&rsquo;m overcommitted,&rdquo; there are a variety of ways of refusing someone clearly and politely without actually using the word no.</p>

<p>everyone is selling something&mdash;an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion&mdash;in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it.</p>

<p>When you say no, there is usually a short-term impact on the relationship. After all, when someone asks for something and doesn&rsquo;t get it, his or her immediate reaction may be annoyance or disappointment or even anger. This downside is clear.
  The potential upside, however, is less obvious: when the initial annoyance or disappointment or anger wears off, the respect kicks in. When we push back effectively, <em>it shows people that our time is highly valuable.</em></p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER THAT A CLEAR &ldquo;NO&rdquo; CAN BE MORE GRACEFUL THAN A VAGUE OR NONCOMMITTAL &ldquo;YES&rdquo;</strong></p>

<div class="important">
  <br>
  <h4>The &ldquo;No&rdquo; Repertoire</h4>
  <ol class="detail-list">
    <li><i>The awkward pause.</i> Instead of being controlled by the threat of an awkward silence, own it. Use it as a tool. When a request comes to you (obviously this works only in person), just pause for a moment. Count to three before delivering
      your verdict. Or if you get a bit more bold, simply wait for the other person to fill the void.</li>

    <li><i>The soft &ldquo;no&rdquo; (or the &ldquo;no but&rdquo;).</i> I recently received an e-mail inviting me to coffee. I replied: &ldquo;I am consumed with writing my book right now :) But I would love to get together once the book is finished.
      Let me
      know if we can get together towards the end of the summer.&rdquo;<br>
      E-mail is also a good way to start practicing saying &ldquo;no but&rdquo; because it gives you the chance to draft and redraft your &ldquo;no&rdquo; to make it as graceful as possible. Plus, many people find that the distance of e-mail reduces
      the fear of awkwardness.</li>

    <li><i>&ldquo;Let me check my calendar and get back to you.&rdquo;</i></li>

    <li><i>Use e-mail bouncebacks.</i> It is totally natural and expected to get an autoresponse when someone is traveling or out of the office. Really, this is the most socially acceptable &ldquo;no&rdquo; there is. People aren&rsquo;t saying
      they
      don&rsquo;t want to reply to your e-mail, they&rsquo;re just saying they can&rsquo;t get back to you for a period of time. So why limit these to vacations and holidays? When I was writing this book I set an e-mail bounceback with the subject
      line
      &ldquo;In Monk Mode.&rdquo; The e-mail said: &ldquo;Dear Friends, I am currently working on a new book which has put enormous burdens on my time. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond in the manner I would like. For this, I
      apologize.&mdash;Greg.&rdquo; And guess what? People seemed to adapt to my temporary absence and nonresponsiveness just fine.</li>

    <li><i>Say, &ldquo;Yes. What should I deprioritize?&rdquo; </i></li>

    <li><i>Say it with humor.</i></li>

    <li><i>Use the words &ldquo;You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y.&rdquo;</i> For example, &ldquo;You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.&rdquo; By this you are also saying, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be
      able to drive you.&rdquo; You <i>are</i> saying what you will not do, but you are couching it in terms of what you are willing to do. This is a particularly good way to navigate a request you would like to support somewhat but cannot throw your
      full
      weight behind.<br>
      I particularly like this construct because it also expresses a respect for <i>the other person&rsquo;s</i> ability to choose, as well as your own. It reminds both parties of the choices they have.</li>

    <li><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, but X might be interested.&rdquo;</i></li>

<h4>UNCOMMIT<br>Win Big by Cutting Your Losses</h4>

  <p>HALF OF THE TROUBLES OF THIS LIFE CAN BE TRACED TO SAYING YES TOO QUICKLY AND NOT SAYING NO SOON ENOUGH.</p>
  <p class="author">Josh Billings</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PRETEND YOU DON&rsquo;T OWN IT YET</strong></p>

<p>Instead of asking, &ldquo;How much do I value this item?&rdquo; we should ask, <em>&ldquo;If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?&rdquo;</em> We can do the same for opportunities and commitment. Don&rsquo;t ask, &ldquo;How
  will I
  feel if I miss out on this opportunity?&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;If I did not have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it?&rdquo; Similarly, we can ask, &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t already involved in this
  project, how hard would I work to get on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There should be no shame in admitting to a mistake; after all, we really are only admitting that we are now wiser than we once were.</p>

<p><strong>APPLY ZERO-BASED BUDGETING</strong></p>

<p>Typically, when accountants allocate a budget they use last year&rsquo;s budget as the baseline for the next year&rsquo;s projection. But with zero-based budgeting, they use zero as the baseline. In other words, every item in the proposed budget
  must be justified from scratch. While this takes more effort it has many advantages: it efficiently allocates resources on the basis of needs rather than history, it detects exaggerated budget requests, it draws attention to obsolete operations,
  and it encourages people to be clearer in their purpose and how their expenses align to that project.
  <br><em>You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavors. Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off. All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you
    would
    add today. You can do this with everything from the financial obligations you have to projects you are committed to, even relationships you are in. Every use of time, energy, or resources has to justify itself anew. If it no longer fits,
    eliminate
    it altogether.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>FROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK</strong></p>

<p>It might sound obvious, but pausing for just five seconds before offering your services can greatly reduce the possibility of making a commitment you&rsquo;ll regret. Before the words &ldquo;That sounds great, I&rsquo;d love to&rdquo; fly out of
  your mouth, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is this essential?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve already made a casual commitment you&rsquo;re regretting, find a nice way to worm your way out. Simply apologize and tell the person that when you made the commitment you
  didn&rsquo;t fully realize what it would entail.</p>

<p><strong>RUN A REVERSE PILOT</strong></p>

<p><em>In a reverse pilot you test whether <i>removing</i> an initiative or activity will have any negative consequences.</em></p>

<p>Are there commitments you routinely make to customers, colleagues, friends or even family members that you have always assumed made a big difference to them but that in fact they might barely notice? By quietly eliminating or at least scaling back
  an activity for a few days or weeks you might be able to assess whether it is really making a difference or whether no one really cares.</p>

<h4>EDIT<br>The Invisible Art</h4>

<p>taking on the role of an editor in your life</p>

<p>&ldquo;By editorial I mean there are a thousand things we could be doing. But there [are] only one or two that are important.&quot;</p>

<p>Likewise, in life, disciplined editing... increases your ability to focus on and give energy to the things that really matter. It lends the most meaningful relationships and activities more space to
  blossom.</p>

<p>Or, as one book editor put it: &ldquo;My job is to make life as effortless as possible for the reader. The goal is to help the reader have the clearest possible understanding of the most important message or takeaway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, editing also involves making trade-offs. Instead of trying to fit it all in&mdash;every character, every plot twist, every detail&mdash;an editor asks, &ldquo;Will this character or plot twist or detail make it better?&rdquo;</p>

      <td>Eliminates the distracting words, images, and details</td>
    </tr>

<p><strong>CUT OUT OPTIONS</strong></p>

<p>To state the obvious, editing involves cutting out things that confuse the reader and cloud the message or story. It is a matter of record that well-edited movies and books are easy on the eye and the brain.
  <br>Since ultimately, having fewer options actually makes a decision &ldquo;easier on the eye and the brain,&rdquo; we must summon the discipline to get rid of options or activities that may be good, or even really good, but that get in the way.
</p>

<p><strong>CONDENSE</strong></p>

<p>An editor is ruthless in the pursuit of making every word count. Instead of saying it in two sentences, can you say it in one? Is it possible to use one word where two are currently being used? As Alan D. Williams observed in the essay &ldquo;What
  Is an Editor?&rdquo; there are &ldquo;two basic questions the editor should be addressing to the author: Are you saying what you want to say? and, Are you saying it as clearly and concisely as possible?&rdquo; Condensing means saying it as
  clearly and concisely as possible.
  <br>Likewise, in life, condensing allows us to do more with less.
  <br><em>We need to eliminate multiple meaningless activities and replace them with one very meaningful activity.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>CORRECT</strong></p>

<p>in our own professional or private lives we can make course corrections by coming back to our core purpose.</p>

<p>Becoming an editor in our lives also includes knowing when to show restraint. One way we can do this is by editing our tendency to step in. When we are added onto an e-mail thread, for example, we can resist our usual temptation to be the first to
  reply all. When sitting in a meeting, we can resist the urge to add our two cents. We can wait. We can observe. We can see how things develop. Doing less is not just a powerful Essentialist strategy, it&rsquo;s a powerful editorial one as well.</p>

<h4>LIMIT<br>The Freedom of Setting Boundaries</h4>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p><i>NO</i> IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE.</p>
  <p class="author">Anne Lamott</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have some people in our lives who tend to be higher maintenance for us than others. These are the people who make their problem our problem. They distract us from our purpose. They care only about their own agendas, and if we let them they
  prevent us from making our highest level of contribution by siphoning our time and energy off to activities that are essential to <i>them</i>, rather than those that are essential to us.</p>

<p>...when people make their problem our problem, we aren't helping them; we&rsquo;re enabling them. Once we take their problem for them, all we&rsquo;re doing is taking away their ability to solve it.
  <br>The author Henry Cloud tells a story about just this kind of situation in his book Boundaries. Once, the parents of a twenty-five-year-old man came to see him. They wanted him to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; their son. He asked them why they had come
  without
  their son, and they said, &ldquo;Well, he doesn't think he has a problem.&rdquo; After listening to their story Henry concluded, to their surprise: &ldquo;I think your son is right. He doesn't have a problem.&#8230; You do.&#8230; You pay, you
  fret, you worry, you plan, you exert energy to keep him going. He doesn't have a problem because you have taken it from him.&rdquo;
  <br>Cloud then offered them a metaphor. Imagine a neighbor who never waters his lawn. But whenever you turn on your sprinkler system, the water falls on his lawn. Your grass is turning brown and dying, but Bill looks down at his green grass and
  thinks
  to himself, &ldquo;My yard is doing fine.&rdquo; Thus everyone loses: your efforts have been wasted, and Bill never develops the habit of watering his own lawn. The solution? As Cloud puts it, &ldquo;You need some fences to keep his problems out of
  your yard and in his, where they belong.&rdquo;
  <br>Whoever it is that&rsquo;s trying to siphon off your time and energies for their own purpose, the only solution is to put up fences. And not at the moment the request is made&mdash;you need to put up your fences well in advance, clearly
  demarcating what&rsquo;s off limits so you can head off time wasters and boundary pushers at the pass.
</p>

<p><strong>FIND YOUR DEALBREAKERS</strong></p>

<p>The simple reality is, if you can&rsquo;t articulate [your boundaries] to yourself and others, it may be unrealistic to
  expect other people to respect them or even figure them out.</p>

<p>Think of one person who frequently pulls you off your most essential path. Make a list of your dealbreakers&mdash;the types of requests or activities from that person that you simply refuse to say yes to unless they somehow overlap with your own
  priorities or agenda.
  <br>Another quick test for <i>finding</i> your dealbreakers is to write down any time you feel violated or put upon by someone&rsquo;s request. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be in some extreme way for you to notice it. Even a small &ldquo;pinch&rdquo;
  (to
  use a description I think is helpful for describing a minor violation of your boundaries) that makes you feel even a twinge of resentment&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s an unwanted invitation, an unsolicited &ldquo;opportunity,&rdquo; or a request
  for a small favor&mdash;is a clue for discovering your own hidden boundaries.
</p>

<p><strong>CRAFT SOCIAL CONTRACTS</strong></p>

<h3>EXECUTE<br>How to Make Execution Effortless</h3>

<p>While Nonessentialists tend to force execution, Essentialists invest the time they have saved by eliminating the nonessentials into <em>designing a system to make execution almost effortless.</em></p>

<p>In other words, once you&rsquo;ve figured out which activities and efforts to keep in your life, you have to have a system for executing them.</p>

<br>
<h4>BUFFER<br>The Unfair Advantage</h4>

<p>A &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; can be defined literally as something that prevents two things from coming into contact and harming each other. For example, a &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; at the periphery of a protected environmental area is an area of land
  that is used to create extra space between that area and any potential threats that might infiltrate it.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can reduce the friction of executing the essential in our work and lives simply by creating a buffer.</p>

<p>From chemistry we know that gases expand to fill the space they are in; similarly, we&rsquo;ve all experienced how projects and commitments tend to expand&mdash;despite our best efforts&mdash;to fill the amount of time allotted to them.
  <br>Just think of how often this happens in presentations, meetings, and workshops you have attended. How many times have you seen someone try to fit too many slides into too little time? How many times have you been to a conference where you felt
  that the presenter cut off a meaningful conversation because of feeling obliged to get through all the content he or she had planned? I have seen this so often, it has started to seem the default position. So when I worked with a facilitator who
  had a different philosophy it was truly liberating. He was designing a four-hour workshop. But instead of allowing the typical ten minutes at the end of the session for questions and comments he suggested a full hour. He explained, &ldquo;I like
  to allow a luxurious amount of time just in case things come up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>When a Nonessentialist receives a windfall, she tends to consume it rather than to set it aside for a rainy day.
  <br>The way of the Essentialist, on the other hand, is to use the good times to create a buffer for the bad.
</p>

<p><strong>USE EXTREME PREPARATION</strong></p>

<p>The value of extreme preparation on a grander scale can be seen in the story of Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott in their race to be the first people in modern history to reach the South Pole. Both men had exactly the same objective. But
  their approaches differed.4 Amundsen prepared for anything and everything that could possibly go wrong; Scott hoped for the best-case scenario. He brought just one thermometer for the trip and was furious when it broke. Amundsen brought four
  thermometers. Scott stored one ton of food for his seventeen men. Amundsen stored three tons. Scott stashed supplies for the return journey in one spot marked with a single flag, meaning that if he went even a fraction off course his team could
  miss it. Amundsen, by contrast, planted twenty markers, miles apart, to ensure that his team would see them. Roald Amundsen prepared diligently and read obsessively for his journey, whereas Robert Falcon Scott did the bare minimum.</p>

<p><strong>ADD 50 PERCENT TO YOUR TIME ESTIMATE</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever underestimated how long a task will take? If you have, you are far from alone. The term for this very common phenomenon is the &ldquo;planning fallacy.&rdquo; This term, coined by Daniel Kahneman in 1979, refers to people&rsquo;s
  tendency to underestimate how long a task will take, <i>even when they have actually done the task before.</i>
  <br>One way to protect against this is simply to add a 50 percent buffer to the amount of time we estimate it will take to complete a task or project&#8230;
</p>

<p><strong>CONDUCT SCENARIO PLANNING</strong></p>

<p>Think of the most important project you are trying to get done at work or at home. Then ask the following five questions: (1) What risks do you face on this project? (2) What is the worst-case scenario? (3) What would the social effects of this
  be? (4) What would the financial impact of this be? and (5) How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience? Your answer to that fifth and crucial question will point you to buffers&mdash;perhaps adding another 20
  percent to the project&rsquo;s budget, or getting a PR person on board to handle any potential negative press, or calling a board meeting to manage shareholder expectations&mdash;that you can create to safeguard you against unknowable events.</p>

<br>
<h4>SUBTRACT<br>Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles</h4>

<p>The question is this: What is the &ldquo;slowest hiker&rdquo; in your job or your life? What is the obstacle that is keeping you back from achieving what really matters to you? By systematically identifying and removing this
  &ldquo;constraint&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be able to significantly reduce the friction keeping you from executing what is essential.
  <br>But this can&rsquo;t be done in a haphazard way. Simply finding things that need fixing here and there might lead to marginal, short-term improvements at best; <em>at worst, you&rsquo;ll waste time and effort improving things that don&rsquo;t
    really
    matter.</em> But if you really want to improve the overall functioning of the system&mdash;whether that system is a manufacturing process, a procedure in your department, or some routine in your daily life&mdash;you need to identify the
  &ldquo;slowest
  hiker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>Essentialists don&rsquo;t default to Band-Aid solutions. Instead of looking for the most obvious or immediate obstacles, they look for the ones slowing down progress. They ask, <em>&ldquo;What is getting in the way of achieving what is
    essential?&rdquo;</em> While the Nonessentialist is busy applying more and more pressure and piling on more and more solutions, the Essentialist simply makes a one-time investment in removing obstacles.</p>

      <td>Piles on quick-fix solutions</td>
      <td>Removes obstacles to progress</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Instead of focusing on the efforts and resources we need to add, the Essentialist focuses on the constraints or obstacles we need to remove.</p>

<p><strong>IDENTIFY THE &ldquo;SLOWEST HIKER&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Instead of just jumping into the project, take a few minutes to think. Ask yourself, &ldquo;What are all the obstacles standing between me and getting this done?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is keeping me from completing this?&rdquo; Make a list of
  these obstacles. They might include: not having the information you need, your energy level, your desire for perfection. Prioritize the list using the question, <em>&ldquo;What is the obstacle that, if removed, would make the majority of other
    obstacles disappear?&rdquo;</em></p>

<br>
<h4>PROGRESS<br>The Power of Small Wins</h4>

<p>Why, he [Ward Clapham] asked, do all of our policing efforts have to be so reactive, so negative, and so after the fact? What if, instead of just focusing on catching criminals&mdash;and serving up ever harsher punishments&mdash;<i>after</i> they
  committed the crime, the police devoted significant resources and effort to eliminating criminal behavior <i>before</i> it happens?
  <br>Out of these questions came the novel idea for Positive Tickets, a program whereby police, instead of focusing on catching young people perpetrating crimes, would focus on catching youth doing something good&mdash;something as simple as
  throwing
  litter away in a bin rather than on the ground, wearing a helmet while riding their bike, skateboarding in the designated area, or getting to school on time&mdash;and would give them a ticket for <i>positive</i> behavior. The ticket, of course,
  wouldn&rsquo;t carry a fine like a parking ticket but instead would be redeemable for some kind of small reward, like free entry to the movies or to an event at a local youth center&mdash;wholesome activities that also had the bonus of keeping
  the young people off the streets and out of trouble.
</p>

<p>Multiply that type of positive interaction by forty thousand times a year for ten years and you can sense why it started to make a difference. Each time a young person was recognized and commended for doing something good, he or she was that much
  more motivated to continue doing good until, eventually, doing good became natural and effortless.</p>

</p>

<p>Instead of starting big and then flaring out with nothing to show for it other than time and energy wasted, to really get essential things done we need to start small and build momentum. Then we can use that momentum to work toward the next win,
  and the next one and so on until we have a significant breakthrough&mdash;and when we do, our progress will have become so frictionless and effortless that the breakthrough will seem like overnight success.</p>

<p>Indeed, today Zimbardo is attempting a grand social experiment along those lines called the &ldquo;Heroic Imagination Project.&rdquo; The logic is to increase the odds of people operating with courage by teaching them the principles of heroism. By
  encouraging and rewarding heroic acts, Zimbardo believes, we can consciously and deliberately create a system where heroic acts eventually become natural and effortless.</p>

<p>My wife Anna and I have tried to apply these ideas to our system of parenting. At one point, we had become concerned with how much screen time had crept into our family. Between television, computers, tablets, and smart phones it had become just
  too easy for the children to waste time on nonessential entertainment. But our attempts to get them to change these habits, as you can imagine, were met with friction. The children would complain whenever we turned the TV off or tried to limit
  their &ldquo;screen time.&rdquo; And we as the parents had to consciously police the situation, which took <i>us</i> away from doing things that were essential.
  <br>So we introduced a token system. The children were given ten tokens at the beginning of the week. These could each be traded in for either thirty minutes of screen time or fifty cents at the end of the week, adding up to $5 or five hours of
  screen time a week. If a child read a book for thirty minutes, he or she would earn an additional token, which could also be traded in for screen time or for money. The results were incredible: overnight, screen time went down 90 percent,
  reading went up by the same amount, <i>and</i> the overall effort we had to put into policing the system went way, way down. In other words, nonessential activity dramatically decreased and essential activity dramatically increased. Once a small
  amount of initial effort was invested to set up the system, it worked without friction.
</p>

<p><strong>FOCUS ON MINIMAL VIABLE PROGRESS</strong></p>

<p>A popular idea in Silicon Valley is &ldquo;Done is better than perfect.&rdquo; The sentiment is not that we should produce rubbish. The idea, as I read it, is not to waste time on nonessentials and just to get the thing done. In entrepreneurial
  circles the idea is expressed as creating a &ldquo;minimal viable product.&rdquo; The idea is, <em>&ldquo;What is the simplest possible product that will be useful and valuable to the intended customer?&rdquo;</em>
  <br>Similarly, we can adopt a method of &ldquo;minimal viable progress.&rdquo; We can ask ourselves, <em>&ldquo;What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to the essential task we are trying to get done?&rdquo;</em> I
  used this
  practice in writing this book. For example, when I was still in the exploratory mode of the book, before I&rsquo;d even begun to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard), I would share a short idea (my minimal viable product) on Twitter. If it
  seemed to resonate with people there, I would write a blog piece on <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. Through this iterative process, which required very little effort, I was able to find where there seemed to be a connection between what I was
  thinking and what seemed to have the highest relevancy in other people&rsquo;s lives.
  <br>It is the process Pixar uses on their movies. Instead of starting with a script, they start with storyboards&mdash;or what have been described as the comic book version of a movie. They try ideas out and see what works. They do this in small
  cycles hundreds of times. Then they put out a movie to small groups of people to give them advance feedback. This allows them to learn as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible.
</p>

<p><strong>DO THE MINIMAL VIABLE PREPARATION</strong></p>

<p>There are two opposing ways to approach an important goal or deadline. You can start early and small or start late and big. &ldquo;Late and big&rdquo; means doing it all at the last minute: pulling an all-nighter and &ldquo;making it
  happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Early and small&rdquo; means starting at the earliest possible moment with the minimal possible time investment.</p>

<p><em>Take a goal or deadline you have coming up and ask yourself, &ldquo;What is the minimal amount I could do <i>right now</i> to prepare?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>If you have a big presentation coming up over the next few weeks or months, open a file right now and spend four minutes starting to put down any ideas. Then close the file.</p>

<p>A colleague in New York uses a simple hack: whenever she schedules a meeting or phone call, she takes exactly fifteen seconds to type up the main objectives for that meeting, so on the morning of the meeting when she sits down to prepare talking
  points she can refer to them. She doesn&rsquo;t need to plan the whole meeting agenda. Just a few seconds of early preparation pay a valuable dividend.</p>

<h4>FLOW<br>The Genius of Routine</h4>

<p>Routine is one of the most powerful tools for removing obstacles. Without routine, the pull of nonessential distractions will overpower us. But if we create a routine that enshrines the essentials, we will begin to execute them on autopilot.
  <br>We won&rsquo;t have to expend precious energy every day prioritizing everything. We must simply expend a small amount of initial energy to create the routine, and then all that is left to do is follow it.
</p>

<p>Our ability to execute the essential improves with practice, just like any other ability.</p>

<p>There is another cognitive advantage to routine as well. Once the mental work shifts to the basal ganglia, mental space is freed up to concentrate on something new. This allows us to autopilot the execution of one essential activity while
  simultaneously actively engaging in another, without sacrificing our level of focus or contribution. &ldquo;In fact, the brain starts working less and less,&rdquo; says Charles Duhigg, author of the book <i>The Power of Habit</i>. &ldquo;The brain
  can
  almost completely shut down.&#8230; And this is a real advantage, because it means you have all of this mental activity you can devote to something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>OVERHAUL YOUR TRIGGERS</strong></p>

<p>In an interview about his book <i>The Power of Habit</i> Charles Duhigg said &ldquo;in the last 15 years, as we&rsquo;ve learned how habits work and how they can be changed, scientists have explained that every habit is made up of a cue, a
  routine, and a reward. The cue is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine&mdash;the behavior itself&mdash;which can bephysical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward,
  which helps your brain figure out if this particular habit is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop&mdash;cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward&mdash;becomes more automatic as the cue and reward become neurologically
  intertwined.&rdquo;
  <br>What this means is that <em>if we want to change our routine,</em> we don&rsquo;t really need to change the behavior. Rather, <em>we need to find the <i>cue</i> that is triggering the nonessential activity or behavior and find a way to
    associate that same cue with something that <i>is</i> essential.</em> So, for example, if the bakery you pass on the way home from work triggers you to pick up a doughnut, next time you pass by that bakery, use that cue to remind you to pick up a
  salad from the deli across the street. Or if your alarm clock going off in the morning triggers you to check your e-mail, use it as a cue to get up and read instead. At first, overcoming the temptation to stop at the bakery or check the e-mail will
  be difficult. But each time you execute the new behavior&mdash;each time you pick up the salad&mdash;strengthens the link in your brain between the cue and the new behavior, and soon, you&rsquo;ll be <i>subconsciously and automatically</i>
  performing the new routine.
</p>

<p><strong>CREATE NEW TRIGGERS</strong></p>

<p>I used this technique to develop the daily routine of writing in a journal, and it worked wonders for me. For a long time I wrote in my journal only sporadically. I would put it off all day; then at night I would
  rationalize, “I will do it in the morning.” But inevitably I wouldn’t, and then by the next night I had two days’ worth to write and it was overwhelming. So I put it off again. And so on... So I started
  putting my journal in my bag right next to my phone. That way, when I pull my phone out of my bag to charge it each evening (already a well-established habit) I see the journal, and this cues me to write in it.

<p><strong>DO THE MOST DIFFICULT THING FIRST</strong></p>

<h4>FOCUS<br>What&rsquo;s Important Now?</h4>

<p>It is mind-bending to consider that in practical terms we only ever have now. We can&rsquo;t control the future in a literal sense, just the now.</p>

<p>Nonessentialists tend to be so preoccupied with past successes and failures, as well as future challenges and opportunities, that they miss the present moment. They become distracted. Unfocused. They aren&rsquo;t really there.
  <br>The way of the Essentialist is to tune into the present.
  <br>To focus on the things that are truly important&mdash;not yesterday or tomorrow, but right now.

<p>Recently Anna and I met for lunch in the middle of a busy workday. Usually when we meet for lunch we&rsquo;re so busy catching each other up on the events of our mornings or planning the activities for the evening that we forget to enjoy the act
  of having lunch together in the here and now. So this time, as the food arrived, Anna suggested an experiment: we should focus only on the moment. No rehashing our morning meetings, no talking about who would pick up the children from karate or
  what we&rsquo;d cook for dinner that night. We should eat slowly and deliberately, fully focused on the present.
  <br>As I slowly took my first bite something happened. I noticed my breathing. Then without conscious intent I found it slowing. Suddenly, time itself felt as if it was moving slower. Instead of feeling as if my body was in one place and my mind
  was
  in five other places, I felt as though both my mind and my body were fully there.
  <br>The sensation stayed with me into the afternoon, where I noticed another change. Instead of being interrupted by distracting thoughts, I was able to give my full concentration to my work. Because I was calm and present on the tasks at hand,
  each
  one flowed naturally. Instead of my usual state of having my mental energies split and scattered across many competing subjects, my state was one of being focused on the subject that was most important in the present. Getting my work done not
  only became more effortless but actually gave me joy.
</p>

<p><strong>Multitasking Versus Multifocusing</strong></p>

<p>&#8230;we can easily do two things at the same time: wash the dishes and listen to the radio, eat and talk, clear the clutter on our desk while thinking about where to go for lunch, text message while watching television, and so on.</p>

<p>What we can&rsquo;t do is <i>concentrate</i> on two things at the same time. When I talk about being present, I&rsquo;m not talking about doing only one thing at a time. I&rsquo;m talking about being focused on one thing at a time. Multitasking
  itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can &ldquo;multi<i>focus</i>&rdquo; is.</p>

<p>How to Be in the Now</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE OUT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW</strong></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What do you need to do to be able to go to sleep peacefully?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>When faced with so many tasks and obligations that you can&rsquo;t figure out which to tackle first, stop. Take a deep breath. Get present in the moment and ask yourself what is most important this very second&mdash;not what&rsquo;s most important
  tomorrow or even an hour from now. If you&rsquo;re not sure, make a list of everything vying for your attention and cross off anything that is not important <i>right now</i>.</p>

<p><strong>GET THE FUTURE OUT OF YOUR HEAD</strong></p>

<p>Getting the future out of your head enables you to more fully focus on &ldquo;what is important now.&rdquo; In this case, my next step was to sit down and list those things that might have been essential&mdash;just not right now. So I opened to
  another page in my journal. This time, I asked myself, <em>&ldquo;What might you want to do someday as a result of today?&rdquo;</em>
  <br>This had two purposes. First, it ensured I wouldn&rsquo;t forget about those ideas, which might prove useful later. Second, it alleviated that stressful and distracting feeling that I needed to act upon them right this second.
</p>

<p><strong>PRIORITIZE</strong></p>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p>In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.</p>
  <p class="author">Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This focus on being in the moment affects the way he [Thich Nhat Hanh] does everything. He takes a full hour to drink a cup of tea with the other monks every day. He explains: &ldquo;Suppose you are drinking a cup of tea. When you hold your cup,
  you may like to breathe in, to bring your mind back to your body, and you become fully present. And when you are truly there, something else is also there&mdash;life, represented by the cup of tea. In that moment you are real, and the cup of tea is
  real. You are not lost in the past, in the future, in your projects, in your worries. You are free from all of these afflictions. And in that state of being free, you enjoy your tea. That is the moment of happiness, and of peace.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<h4>BE<br>The Essentialist Life</h4>

<p><strong>As these ideas become emotionally true, they take on the power to change you.</strong></p>

<p>Mohandas K. Gandhi went to South Africa and saw oppression there. Suddenly, he found a higher purpose: the liberation of the oppressed everywhere.</p>

<p>With this new singleness of purpose, he eliminated everything else from his life. He called the process &ldquo;reducing himself to zero.&rdquo; He dressed in his own homespun cloth (khadi) and inspired his followers to do the same. <em>He spent
    three years not reading any newspapers because he found that their contents added only nonessential confusion to his life. He spent thirty-five years experimenting with simplifying his diet. He spent a day each week without speaking. It would
    be an understatement to say he eschewed consumerism: when he died he owned fewer than ten items.</em></p>

<p><strong>Living Essentially</strong></p>

<p>There are two ways of thinking about Essentialism. The first is to think of it as something you <i>do</i> occasionally. The second is to think of it as something you <i>are</i>. In the former, Essentialism is one more thing to add to your already
  overstuffed life. In the latter, it is a different way&mdash;a simpler way&mdash;of doing everything. It becomes a lifestyle.</p>

<p>It is easy to get caught up in the &ldquo;paradox of success&rdquo; we discussed in chapter 1. We have clarity of purpose, which leads us to success. But with our success we get new options and opportunities. This sounds like a good thing, but
  remember, these options unintentionally distract us, tempt us, lure us away. Our clarity becomes clouded, and soon we find ourselves spread too thin. Now, instead of being utilized at our highest level of contribution, we make only a millimeter
  of progress in a million directions. Ultimately, our success becomes a catalyst for our failure. The only way out of this cycle is the way of the Essentialist.</p>

<p><em>When we look back on our careers and our lives, would we rather see a long laundry list of &ldquo;accomplishments&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t really matter or just a few major accomplishments that have real meaning and significance?</em></p>

<p>Once you become an Essentialist, you will find that you aren&rsquo;t like everybody else. <em>When other people are saying yes, you will find yourself saying no. When other people are doing, you will find yourself thinking. When other people are
    speaking, you will find yourself listening. When other people are in the spotlight, vying for attention, you will find yourself waiting on the sidelines until it is time to shine. While other people are padding their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and
    building out their LinkedIn profiles, you will be building a career of meaning.</em> While other people are complaining (read: bragging) about how busy they are, you will just be smiling sympathetically, unable to relate. While other people are
  living a life of stress and chaos, you will be living a life of impact and fulfillment. In many ways, <em>to live as an Essentialist in our too-many-things-all-the-time society is an act of quiet revolution.</em></p>

<p>&#8230;on my worst days I have wondered if my tombstone will read, &ldquo;He checked e-mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What being an Essentialist means to me is best illustrated in the little moments. It means:</p>

<ul class="detail-list">
  <li> Choosing to wrestle with my children on the trampoline instead of going to a networking event</li>

  <li> Choosing to say no to international client work for the last year in order to write</li>

  <li> Choosing to set aside a day each week where I don&rsquo;t check any social media so I can be fully present at home</li>

  <li> Choosing to spend eight months getting up at 5:00 A.M. every morning and writing till 1:00 P.M. in order to finish this book</li>

  <li> Choosing to push back a work deadline in order to go camping with my children</li>

  <li> Choosing not to watch any television or movies when I travel for business so there is time to think and rest</li>

  <li> Choosing to regularly spend a whole day on that day&rsquo;s priority, even if it means doing nothing else on my to-do list</li>

  <li> Choosing to put the novel I am reading on hold because it is not the priority today</li>

  <li> Choosing to keep a journal almost every day for the last ten years</li>

  <li> Choosing to say no to a speaking opportunity in order to have a date night with Anna</li>

  <li> Choosing to exchange time on Facebook for a regular call with my ninety-three-year-old grandfather</li>

  <li> Choosing to turn down a recent offer to be a lecturer at Stanford since I knew it meant time away from spreading the message of Essentialism through my lectures, and being with family</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the ways the disciplined pursuit of less can change your life for the better.</p>

<p><strong>MORE CLARITY</strong></p>

<p>Life will become less about efficiently crossing off what was on your to-do list or rushing through everything on your schedule and more about changing what you put on there in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>MORE CONTROL</strong></p>

<p>You will gain confidence in your ability to pause, push back, or not rush in. You will feel less and less a function of other people&rsquo;s to-do lists and agendas. Remember that if you don&rsquo;t prioritize your life someone else will.</p>

<p><strong>MORE JOY IN THE JOURNEY</strong></p>

<p>With the focus on what is truly important <i>right now</i> comes the ability to live life more fully, in the moment.</p>

<p>As the Dalai Lama, another true Essentialist, has said: &ldquo;If one&rsquo;s life is simple, contentment has to come. Simplicity is extremely important for happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Essential Life: Living a Life That <i>Really</i> Matters</strong></p>

<p>When I need a reminder of this I think of a story. It is about a man whose three-year-old daughter died. In his grief he put together a video of her short little life. But as he went through all of his home videos he realized something was
  missing. He had taken video of every outing they had gone on and every trip they had taken. He had lots of footage&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t the problem. But then he realized that while he had plenty of footage of the places they had gone&mdash;the
  sights they had seen, the views they had enjoyed, the meals they had eaten, and the landmarks they had visited&mdash;he had almost no close-up footage of his daughter herself. He had been so busy recording the surroundings he had failed to record
  what was essential.</p>

<p>This story captures the two most personal learnings that have come to me on the long journey of writing this book. The first is the exquisitely important role of my family in my life. At the very, very end, everything else will fade into
  insignificance by comparison. The second is <em>the pathetically tiny amount of time we have left of our lives. For me this is not a depressing thought but a thrilling one. It removes fear of choosing the wrong thing. It infuses courage into my
    bones.
    It challenges me to be even more unreasonably selective about how to use this precious&mdash;and <i>precious</i> is perhaps too insipid of a word&mdash;time.</em></p>

<p>The life of an Essentialist is a life lived without regret. If you have correctly identified what really matters, if you invest your time and energy in it, then it is difficult to regret the choices you make. You become proud of the life you have
  chosen to live.</p>

<p>If you take one thing away from this book, I hope you will remember this: whatever decision or challenge or crossroads you face in your life, simply <em>ask yourself, &ldquo;What is essential?&rdquo; Eliminate everything else.</em></p>
