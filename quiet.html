        <p>Under the restrictive (in some cases repressive) social codes of the Culture of Character, both genders displayed some reserve when it came to the mating dance. Women who were too loud or made inappropriate eye contact with strangers were considered brazen. Upper-class women had more license to speak than did their lower-class counterparts, and indeed were judged partly on their talent for witty repartee, but even they were advised to display blushes and downcast eyes. They were warned by conduct manuals that &ldquo;the coldest reserve&rdquo; was &ldquo;more admirable in a woman a man wishe[d] to make his wife than the least approach to undue familiarity.&rdquo; Men could adopt a quiet demeanor that implied self-possession and a power that didn&rsquo;t need to flaunt itself. Though shyness per se was unacceptable, reserve was a mark of good breeding.</p>

<p>Tony [Robbins] seems the perfect person to demonstrate such skills. He strikes me as having a &ldquo;hyperthymic&rdquo; temperament&mdash;a kind of extroversion-on-steroids characterized, in the words of one psychiatrist, by &ldquo;exuberant, upbeat, overenergetic, and overconfident lifelong traits&rdquo; that have been recognized as an asset in business, especially sales. People with these traits often make wonderful company, as Tony does onstage.</p>

<p>But Mills also pointed to the common phenomenon known as the &ldquo;winner&rsquo;s curse,&rdquo; in which two companies bid competitively to acquire a third, until the price climbs so high that it becomes less an economic activity than a war of egos. The winning bidders will be damned if they&rsquo;ll let their opponents get the prize, so they buy the target company at an inflated price. &ldquo;It tends to be the assertive people who carry the day in these kinds of things,&rdquo; says Mills. &ldquo;You see this all the time. People ask, &lsquo;How did this happen, how did we pay so much?&rsquo; Usually it&rsquo;s said that they were carried away by the situation, but that&rsquo;s not right. Usually they&rsquo;re carried away by people who are assertive and domineering.&quot;</p>

<p>The U.S. Army has a name for a similar phenomenon: &ldquo;the Bus to Abilene.&rdquo; &ldquo;Any army officer can tell you what that means,&rdquo; Colonel (Ret.) Stephen J. Gerras, a professor of behavioral sciences at the U.S. Army War College, told Yale Alumni Magazine in 2008. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a family sitting on a porch in Texas on a hot summer day, and somebody says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m bored. Why don&rsquo;t we go to Abilene?&rsquo; When they get to Abilene, somebody says, &lsquo;You know, I didn&rsquo;t really want to go.&rsquo; And the next person says, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;I thought you wanted to go,&rsquo; and so on. Whenever you&rsquo;re in an army group and somebody says, &lsquo;I think we&rsquo;re all getting on the bus to Abilene here,&rsquo; that is a red flag. You can stop a conversation with it. It is a very powerful artifact of our culture.&rdquo;<br />
The &ldquo;Bus to Abilene&rdquo; anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate action&mdash;any action. </p>

<p>But when he analyzed what the highest-performing companies had in common, the nature of their CEOs jumped out at him. Every single one of them was led by an unassuming man like Darwin Smith. Those who worked with these leaders tended to describe them with the following words: quiet, humble, modest, reserved, shy, gracious, mild-mannered, self-effacing, understated.<br />
The lesson, says Collins, is clear. We don&rsquo;t need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.</p>

<p>McHugh added his own voice to this chorus, first with a blog calling for greater emphasis on religious practices of solitude and contemplation, and later with a book called Introverts in the Church: Finding Our Place in an Extroverted Culture. He argues that evangelism means listening as well as talking, that evangelical churches should incorporate silence and mystery into religious worship, and that they should make room for introverted leaders who might be able to demonstrate a quieter path to God. After all, hasn&rsquo;t prayer always been about contemplation as well as community? Religious leaders from Jesus to Buddha, as well as the lesser-known saints, monks, shamans, and prophets, have always gone off alone to experience the revelations they later shared with the rest of us.</p>

<p>As the service wears on, I feel the same sense of alienation that McHugh has described. Events like this don&rsquo;t give me the sense of oneness others seem to enjoy; it&rsquo;s always been private occasions that make me feel connected to the joys and sorrows of the world, often in the form of communion with writers and musicians I&rsquo;ll never meet in person. Proust called these moments of unity between writer and reader &ldquo;that fruitful miracle of a communication in the midst of solitude.&rdquo; His use of religious language was surely no accident.</p>

<p>McHugh, as if reading my mind, turns to me when the service is over. &ldquo;Everything in the service involved communication,&rdquo; he says with gentle exasperation. &ldquo;Greeting people, the lengthy sermon, the singing. There was no emphasis on quiet, liturgy, ritual, things that give you space for contemplation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evangelicalism has taken the Extrovert Ideal to its logical extreme, McHugh is telling us. If you don&rsquo;t love Jesus out loud, then it must not be real love. It&rsquo;s not enough to forge your own spiritual connection to the divine; <i>it must be displayed publicly.</i> </p>

<p>But he knows that meaningful change will come slowly to a religious culture that sees extroversion not only as a personality trait but also as an indicator of virtue. Righteous behavior is not so much the good we do behind closed doors when no one is there to praise us; it is what we &ldquo;put out into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Janet Farrall and Leonie Kronborg write in Leadership Development for the Gifted and Talented:<br />
While extroverts tend to attain leadership in public domains, introverts tend to attain leadership in theoretical and aesthetic fields. Outstanding introverted leaders, such as Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Patrick White and Arthur Boyd, who have created either new fields of thought or rearranged existing knowledge, have spent long periods of their lives in solitude. Hence leadership does not only apply in social situations, but also occurs in more solitary situations such as developing new techniques in the arts, creating new philosophies, writing profound books and making scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p>The New Groupthink did not arise at one precise moment. Cooperative learning, corporate teamwork, and open office plans emerged at different times and for different reasons. But the mighty force that pulled these trends together was the rise of the World Wide Web, which lent both cool and gravitas to the idea of collaboration. On the Internet, wondrous creations were produced via shared brainpower: Linux, the open-source operating system; Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia; MoveOn.org, the grassroots political movement. These collective productions, exponentially greater than the sum of their parts, were so awe-inspiring that we came to revere the hive mind, the wisdom of crowds, the miracle of crowdsourcing. <i>Collaboration</i> became a sacred concept&mdash;the key multiplier for success.<br />
But then we took things a step further than the facts called for. We came to value transparency and to knock down walls&mdash;not only online but also in person. We failed to realize that what makes sense for the asynchronous, relatively anonymous interactions of the Internet might not work as well inside the face-to-face, politically charged, acoustically noisy confines of an open-plan office. Instead of distinguishing between online and in-person interaction, we used the lessons of one to inform our thinking about the other.</p>

<p>The Internet&rsquo;s role in promoting face-to-face group work is especially ironic because the early Web was a medium that enabled bands of often introverted individualists&mdash;people much like the solitude-craving thought leaders Farrall and Kronborg describe&mdash;to come together to subvert and transcend the usual ways of problem-solving. A significant majority of the earliest computer enthusiasts were introverts&#8230;</p>

<p>But the earliest open-source creators didn&rsquo;t share office space&mdash;often they didn&rsquo;t even live in the same country. Their collaborations took place largely in the ether. This is not an insignificant detail. If you had gathered the same people who created Linux, installed them in a giant conference room for a year, and asked them to devise a new operating system, it&rsquo;s doubtful that anything so revolutionary would have occurred&#8230;</p>

<blockquote class="important"><p>I acquired a central ability that was to help me through my entire career: patience. I&rsquo;m serious. Patience is usually so underrated. I mean, for all those projects, from third grade all the way to eighth grade, I just learned things gradually, figuring out how to put electronic devices together without so much as cracking a book.&#8230; I learned to not worry so much about the outcome, but to concentrate on the step I was on and to try to do it as perfectly as I could when I was doing it.</p>
<p class="author">Stephen Wozniak, <cite>iWoz</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Madeleine L&rsquo;Engle, the author of the classic young adult novel A Wrinkle in Time and more than sixty other books, says that <em>she would never have developed into such a bold thinker had she not spent so much of her childhood alone with books and ideas.</em> As a young boy, Charles Darwin made friends easily but preferred to spend his time taking long, solitary nature walks. (As an adult he was no different. &ldquo;My dear Mr. Babbage,&rdquo; he wrote to the famous mathematician who had invited him to a dinner party, &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for sending me cards for your parties, but I am afraid of accepting them, for I should meet some people there, to whom I have sworn by all the saints in Heaven, I never go out.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>A mountain of recent data on open-plan offices from many different industries corroborates the results of the games. Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory. They&rsquo;re associated with high staff turnover. They make people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and insecure. Open-plan workers are more likely to suffer from high blood pressure and elevated stress levels and to get the flu; they argue more with their colleagues; they worry about coworkers eavesdropping on their phone calls and spying on their computer screens. They have fewer personal and confidential conversations with colleagues. They&rsquo;re often subject to loud and uncontrollable noise, which raises heart rates; releases cortisol, the body&rsquo;s fight-or-flight &ldquo;stress&rdquo; hormone; and makes people socially distant, quick to anger, aggressive, and slow to help others.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that <i>performance gets worse as group size increases</i>: groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared to groups of six, which do worse than groups of four. The &ldquo;evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,&rdquo; writes the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. &ldquo;If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.&rdquo;<br />
The one exception to this is online brainstorming. Groups brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs. The same is true of academic research&mdash;professors who work together electronically, from different physical locations, tend to produce research that is more influential than those either working alone or collaborating face-to-face.<br />
...participating in an online working group is a form of solitude all its own.</p>

<p>Participants in brainstorming sessions usually believe that their group performed much better than it actually did, which points to a valuable reason for their continued popularity&mdash;group brainstorming makes people feel attached. A worthy goal, so long as we understand that social glue, as opposed to creativity, is the principal benefit.</p>

<p>Psychologists usually offer three explanations for the failure of group brainstorming. The first is <i>social loafing</i>: in a group, some individuals tend to sit back and let others do the work. The second is <i>production blocking</i>: only one person can talk or produce an idea at once, while the other group members are forced to sit passively. And the third is <i>evaluation apprehension</i>, meaning the fear of looking stupid in front of one&rsquo;s peers.</p>

<p>But Berns&rsquo;s study also shed light on exactly why we&rsquo;re such conformists. When the volunteers played alone, the brain scans showed activity in a network of brain regions including the occipital cortex and parietal cortex, which are associated with visual and spatial perception, and in the frontal cortex, which is associated with conscious decision-making. But when they went along with their group&rsquo;s wrong answer, their brain activity revealed something very different.<br />
Remember, what Asch wanted to know was whether people conformed despite knowing that the group was wrong, or whether their perceptions had been altered by the group. If the former was true, Berns and his team reasoned, then they should see more brain activity in the decision-making prefrontal cortex. That is, the brain scans would pick up the volunteers deciding consciously to abandon their own beliefs to fit in with the group. But if the brain scans showed heightened activity in regions associated with visual and spatial perception, this would suggest that the group had somehow managed to change the individual&rsquo;s perceptions.<br />
That was exactly what happened&mdash;the conformists showed less brain activity in the frontal, decision-making regions and more in the areas of the brain associated with perception. Peer pressure, in other words, is not only unpleasant, but can actually change your view of a problem.<br />
These early findings suggest that groups are like mind-altering substances. If the group thinks the answer is A, you&rsquo;re much more likely to believe that A is correct, too. It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re saying consciously, &ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure, but they all think the answer&rsquo;s A, so I&rsquo;ll go with that.&rdquo; Nor are you saying, &ldquo;I want them to like me, so I&rsquo;ll just pretend that the answer&rsquo;s A.&rdquo; No, you are doing something much more unexpected&mdash;and dangerous. Most of Berns&rsquo;s volunteers reported having gone along with the group because &ldquo;they thought that they had arrived serendipitously at the same correct answer.&rdquo; They were utterly blind, in other words, to how much their peers had influenced them.<br />
What does this have to do with social fear? Well, remember that the volunteers in the Asch and Berns studies didn&rsquo;t always conform. Sometimes they picked the right answer despite their peers&rsquo; influence. And Berns and his team found something very interesting about these moments. They were linked to heightened activation in the amygdala, a small organ in the brain associated with upsetting emotions such as the fear of rejection.<br />
Berns refers to this as <i>&ldquo;the pain of independence,&rdquo;</i> and it has serious implications. Many of our most important civic institutions, from elections to jury trials to the very idea of majority rule, depend on dissenting voices. But when the group is literally capable of changing our perceptions, and when to stand alone is to activate primitive, powerful, and unconscious feelings of rejection, then the health of these institutions seems far more vulnerable than we think.</p>

<p>The way forward, I&rsquo;m suggesting, is not to stop collaborating face-to-face, but to refine the way we do it. For one thing, we should actively seek out symbiotic introvert-extrovert relationships, in which leadership and other tasks are divided according to people&rsquo;s natural strengths and temperaments. The most effective teams are composed of a healthy mix of introverts and extroverts, studies show, and so are many leadership structures.<br />
We also need to create settings in which people are free to circulate in a shifting kaleidoscope of interactions, and to disappear into their private workspaces when they want to focus or simply be alone. Our schools should teach children the skills to work with others&mdash;cooperative learning can be effective when practiced well and in moderation&mdash;but also the time and training they need to deliberately practice on their own. It&rsquo;s also vital to recognize that many people&mdash;especially introverts like Steve Wozniak&mdash;need extra quiet and privacy in order to do their best work.</p>
<div class="important"><p>Some companies are starting to understand the value of silence and solitude, and are creating &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; open plans that offer a mix of solo workspaces, quiet zones, casual meeting areas, caf&eacute;s, reading rooms, computer hubs, and even &ldquo;streets&rdquo; where people can chat casually with each other without interrupting others&rsquo; workflow. At Pixar Animation Studios, the sixteen-acre campus is built around a football-field-sized atrium housing mailboxes, a cafeteria, and even bathrooms. The idea is to encourage as many casual, chance encounters as possible. At the same time, employees are encouraged to make their individual offices, cubicles, desks, and work areas their own and to decorate them as they wish.</p></div>

<p>I suspect that Wozniak himself would approve of these developments. Before he created the Apple PC, Woz designed calculators at Hewlett-Packard, a job he loved in part because HP made it so easy to chat with others. Every day at 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. management wheeled in donuts and coffee, and people would socialize and swap ideas. What set these interactions apart was how low-key and relaxed they were. In iWoz, he recalls HP as a meritocracy where it didn&rsquo;t matter what you looked like, where there was no premium on playing social games, and where no one pushed him from his beloved engineering work into management. That was what collaboration meant for Woz: the ability to share a donut and a brainwave with his laid-back, nonjudgmental, poorly dressed colleagues&mdash;who minded not a whit when he disappeared into his cubicle to get the real work done.</p>
