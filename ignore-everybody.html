            <p>Plus a big idea will change you. Your friends may love you, but they may not want you to change. If you change, then their dynamic with you also changes. They might prefer things the way they are, that&rsquo;s how they love you&mdash;the way you are, not the way you may become.</p>

<p>If your idea is so good that it changes your dynamic enough to where you need them less or, God forbid, the market needs them less, then they&rsquo;re going to resist your idea every chance they can.</p>

<blockquote class="important"><h4>GOOD IDEAS ALTER THE POWER BALANCE IN RELATIONSHIPS. THAT IS WHY GOOD IDEAS ARE ALWAYS INITIALLY RESISTED.</h4></blockquote>
<p>Good ideas come with a heavy burden, which is why so few people execute them. So few people can handle it.</p>

<h4>2. The idea doesn&rsquo;t have to be big. It just has to be yours.</h4>

<p>The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.</p>

<p>It was so liberating to be doing something that didn&rsquo;t have to impress anybody, for a change.</p>

<p>Doing anything worthwhile takes forever.&#160;</p>

<p>If somebody in your industry is more successful than you, it&rsquo;s probably because he works harder at it than you do. Sure, maybe he&rsquo;s more inherently talented, more adept at networking, but I don&rsquo;t consider that an excuse. Over time, that advantage counts for less and less. Which is why the world is full of highly talented, network-savvy, failed mediocrities.</p>

<p>Keeping one foot in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; makes everything far more manageable for me. The fact that I have another income means I don&rsquo;t feel pressured to do something market-friendly. Instead, I get to do whatever the hell I want. I get to do it for my own satisfaction. And I think that makes the work more powerful in the long run. It also makes it easier to carry on with it in a calm fashion, day-in-day-out, and not go crazy in insane creative bursts brought on by money worries.<br />
The day job, which I really like, gives me something productive and interesting to do among fellow adults. It gets me out of the house in the daytime. If I were a professional cartoonist I&rsquo;d just be chained to a drawing table at home all day, scribbling out a living in silence, interrupted only by frequent trips to the coffee shop. No, thank you.<br />
Simply put, my method allows me to pace myself over the long haul, which is critical.</p>

<p>If I were just starting out writing, say, a novel or a screenplay, or maybe starting up a new software company or an online retail business, I wouldn&rsquo;t try to quit my job in order to make this big, dramatic, heroic-quest thing about it.<br />
I would do something far simpler: I would find that extra hour or two in the day that belongs to nobody else but me, and I would make it productive. Put the hours in, do it for long enough, and magical, life-transforming things happen eventually.&#160;</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve seen this before so many times, both firsthand and with other people. Your idea finally seems to be working, seems to be getting all sorts of traction, and all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got all these swarms of people trying to join the team, trying to get a piece of the action.<br />
And then as soon as they get a foothold inside the inner circle, you soon realize they never really understood your idea in the first place, they just want to be on the winning team. And the weirdest part is, they don&rsquo;t seem to mind sabotaging your original idea that got them interested in the first place, in order to maintain their newfound social status. It&rsquo;s probably the most bizarre bit of human behavior I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed firsthand in business, and it&rsquo;s amazingly common.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Internet, you can now build your own thing without having somebody else &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; you first. Which means when the big boys come along offering you deals, you&rsquo;ll be in a much better position to get exactly what you want from the equation. Big offers are a good thing, but personal sovereignty matters a whole lot more over the long run.</p>

<blockquote class="important"><h4>You are responsible for your own experience.</h4></blockquote>

<p>Your wee voice doesn't want you to sell something. Your wee voice wants you to make<br />
something. <br />
Go ahead and make something. Make something really special. Make something amazing that<br />
will really blow the mind of anybody who sees it.</p>

<h3>THE SEX &amp; CASH THEORY</h3>
<p>The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills.&#160;</p>

<p>If you're creative, if you can think independently, if you can articulate passion, if you can<br />
override the fear of being wrong, then your company needs you now more than it ever did.</p>


<p>Meeting a person who wrote a masterpiece on the back of a deli menu would not surprise me. Meeting a person who wrote a masterpiece with a silver Cartier fountain pen on an antique writing table in an airy SoHo loft would seriously surprise me.</p>

<p>A fancy tool just gives the second-rater one more pillar to hide behind.<br />
Which is why there are so many second-rate art directors with state-of-the-art Macintosh computers.<br />
Which is why there are so many hack writers with state-of-the-art laptops.<br />
Which is why there are so many crappy photographers with state-of-the-art digital cameras.<br />
Which is why there are so many unremarkable painters with expensive studios in trendy neighborhoods.<br />
Hiding behind pillars, all of them.<br />
Pillars do not help; they hinder. The more mighty the pillar, the more you end up relying on it psychologically, the more it gets in your way.</p>

<blockquote class="important"><h4>Don&rsquo;t try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.</h4></blockquote>

<p>There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.</p>

<p>&#8230;there was no artist-lifestyle archetype to conform to.</p>

<h4>13. If you accept the pain, it cannot hurt you.</h4>
<p>The pain of making the necessary sacrifices always hurts more than you think it&rsquo;s going to.<br />
I know. It sucks. That being said,&#160;doing something seriously creative is one of the most amazing experiences one can have, in this or any other lifetime. If you can pull it off, it&rsquo;s worth it.<br />
Even if you don&rsquo;t end up pulling it off, you&rsquo;ll learn many incredible, magical, valuable things. It&rsquo;s not doing it&mdash;when you know full well you had the opportunity&mdash;that hurts far more than any failure.</p>

<h4>15. Dying young is overrated.</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many young people take the &ldquo;Gotta do the drugs and booze thing to make me a better artist&rdquo; route over the years. A choice that wasn&rsquo;t smart, original, effective, healthy, or ended happily.<br />
&#160;&#160;<br />
IT&rsquo;S A FAMILIAR STORY: A KID READS ABOUT&#160;Charlie Parker or Jimi Hendrix or Charles Bukowski and somehow decides that their poetic but flawed example somehow gives him permission and/or absolution to spend the next decade or two drowning in his own metaphorical vomit.<br />
Of course, the older you get, the more casualties of this foolishness you meet. The more time they have had to ravage their lives. The more pathetic they seem. And the less remarkable work they seem to have to show for it, for all their &ldquo;amazing experiences&rdquo; and &ldquo;special insights.&rdquo;<br />
The smarter and more talented the artist is, the less likely he will choose this route. Sure, he might screw around a wee bit while he&rsquo;s young and stupid, but he will move on quicker than most.<br />
But the kid thinks it&rsquo;s all about talent; he thinks it&rsquo;s all about &ldquo;potential.&rdquo; He underestimates how much time, discipline, and stamina also play their part. Sure, like Bukowski et al., there are exceptions. But that is why we like their stories when we&rsquo;re young. Because they are exceptional stories. And every kid with a guitar or a pen or a paintbrush or an idea for a new business wants to be exceptional. Every kid underestimates his competition, and overestimates his chances. Every kid is a sucker for the idea that there&rsquo;s a way to make it without having to do the actual hard work.<br />
So the bars of West Hollywood, London, and New York are awash with people throwing their lives away in the desperate hope of finding a shortcut, any shortcut. And a lot of them aren&rsquo;t even young anymore, their B-plans having been washed away by beer and vodka years ago.<br />
Meanwhile the competition is at home, working their asses off.</p>

<h4>16. The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do from what you are not.</h4>

<p>Art suffers the moment other people start paying for it. The more you need the money, the more people will tell you what to do. The less control you will have. The more bullshit you will have to swallow. The less joy it will bring. Know this and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Part of understanding the creative urge is understanding that it's primal. Wanting to change<br />
the world is not a noble calling; it's a primal calling.</p>

<h4>20. Sing in your own voice.</h4>
<p>Picasso was a terrible colorist. Turner couldn&rsquo;t paint human beings worth a damn. Saul Steinberg&rsquo;s formal drafting skills were appalling. T. S. Eliot had a full-time day job.<br />
Henry Miller was a wildly uneven writer. Bob Dylan can&rsquo;t sing or play guitar.&#160;<br />
BUT THAT DIDN&rsquo;T STOP THEM, RIGHT?<br />
So I guess the next question is, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;<br />
I have no idea. Why should it? <br />
The really good artists, the really successful entrepreneurs, figure out how to circumvent their limitations, figure out how to turn their strengths into weaknesses.&#160;The fact that Turner couldn&rsquo;t draw human beings very well left him no choice but to improve his landscape paintings, which have no equal. Had Bob Dylan been more of a technical virtuoso, he might not have felt the need to give his song lyrics such power and resonance.<br />
Don&rsquo;t make excuses. Just shut the hell up and get on with it. Time waits for no one.</p>


<h4>22. Selling out is harder than it looks.</h4>
<p>Diluting your product to make it more &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; will just make people like it less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the target market is middle-class housewives,&rdquo; I rambled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite conservative, so I thought I&rsquo;d better tone it down. . . .&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You can tone it down once you&rsquo;ve gotten the job and once the client comes after your ass with a red-hot poker and tells you to tone it down.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Till then, show me the toned-up version.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>VIGOROUS DEBATE ABOUT COMMERCIALISM IN&#160;art is a path well trodden, and not a place where one is going to come up with many new, earth-shattering insights. But a lot of people like to dwell on it because it keeps them from ever having to journey into unknown territory. It&rsquo;s safe. It allows you to have strong emotions and opinions without any real risk to yourself. Without your having to do any of the actual hard work involved in the making and selling of something you believe in.<br />
To me, it&rsquo;s not about whether Tom Clancy sells truckloads of books or a Nobel Prize winner sells diddly-squat. Those are just ciphers, external distractions. To me, it&rsquo;s about what you are going to do with the short time you have left on this earth. Different criteria altogether.</p>

<p>Trying to create when you don&rsquo;t feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation. It&rsquo;s not really connecting, it&rsquo;s just droning on like an old, drunken barfly.</p>

<p>A Picasso always looks like Picasso painted it. Hemingway always sounds like Hemingway.<br />
A Beethoven symphony always sounds like a Beethoven symphony. Part of being a master is learning how to sing in nobody else&rsquo;s voice but your own.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
But it wasn&rsquo;t the format that made the art great. It was the fact that somehow while playing around with something new, suddenly they found they were able to put their entire selves into it.<br />
Only then did it become their &ldquo;shtick,&rdquo; their true voice, etc.<br />
That&rsquo;s what people responded to. The humanity, not the form. The voice, not the form.<br />
Put your whole self into it, and you will find your true voice. Hold back and you won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<blockquote class="important"><h4>You can't love a crowd the same way you can love a person.<br />
And a crowd can't love you the way a single person can love you.<br />
Intimacy doesn't scale. Not really. Intimacy is a one-on-one phenomenon.</h4></blockquote>

<h4>29. Power is never given. Power is taken.</h4>

<p>THE MINUTE YOU BECOME READY IS THE MINUTE&#160;you stop dreaming. Suddenly it&rsquo;s no longer about &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; Suddenly it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;doing.&rdquo;<br />
You don&rsquo;t get the dream job because you walk into the editor&rsquo;s office for the first time and go, &ldquo;Hi, I would really love to be a sportswriter one day, please.&rdquo;<br />
You get the job because you walk into the editor&rsquo;s office and go, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m the best frickin&rsquo; sportswriter on the planet.&rdquo; And somehow the editor can tell you aren&rsquo;t lying, either.<br />
You didn&rsquo;t go in there, asking the editor to give you power. You went in there and politely informed the editor that you already have the power. That&rsquo;s what being &ldquo;ready&rdquo; means. That&rsquo;s what &ldquo;taking power&rdquo; means.<br />
Not needing anything from another person in order to be the best in the world.</p>

<p>
PEOPLE ARE FOND OF SPOUTING OUT THE OLD&#160;clich&eacute; about how Van Gogh never sold a painting in his lifetime. Somehow his example serves to justify to us, decades later, that there is merit in utter failure.<br />
Perhaps, but the man did commit suicide. The market for his work took off big-time shortly after his death. Had he decided to stick around another few decades he most likely would&rsquo;ve entered old age quite prosperous. And sadly for failures everywhere, the clich&eacute; would have lost a lot of its power.<br />
The fact is, the old clich&eacute;s work for us in abstract terms, but they never work out in real life quite the same way. Life is messy; clich&eacute;s are clean and tidy.</p>

<p>Anyone can be an idealist. Anyone can be a cynic. The hard part lies somewhere in the middle&mdash;that is, being human.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>33. Allow your work to age with you.</h4>

<p>When I first met Dan, he was a twenty-nine-year-old aspiring filmmaker, living in a one-bedroom apartment down on New York&rsquo;s Lower East Side, who liked to spend too much time in bars.<br />
The last time I saw him, he was a forty-one-year-old aspiring filmmaker, living in a one-bedroom apartment down on New York&rsquo;s Lower East Side, who likes to spend too much time in bars.<br />
There&rsquo;s a famous old quip: &ldquo;A lot of people in business say they have twenty years&rsquo; experience, when in fact all they really have is one year&rsquo;s experience, repeated twenty times.&rdquo;<br />
It&rsquo;s not just guys in business who fall into this trap, unfortunately. It happens just as often to people taking a less conventional path. It&rsquo;s sad enough when you see it happen to a friend of yours. When it happens to you, it&rsquo;s even worse.<br />
The good news is, it&rsquo;s easy enough to avoid. Especially with experience. Suddenly you realize that you&rsquo;re just not into the same things you once were. You used to be into staying up all night, going to parties, and now you&rsquo;d rather stay in and read a book. Sure, it sounds boring, but hey, sometimes &ldquo;boring&rdquo; can be a lot of fun. Especially if it&rsquo;s on your own terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before, this man had a job and a hobby. Now suddenly, he&rsquo;s just got the job, but no hobby anymore. But a man needs both, you see. And now what does this man, who&rsquo;s always had a hobby, do with his time?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>36. Savor obscurity while it lasts.</h4>

<p>IT&rsquo;S A FAMILIAR STORY, RETOLD COUNTLESS&#160;times. A talented person creates something amazing and wonderful when she&rsquo;s young, poor, hungry, and alone, and the world doesn&rsquo;t care. Then one day something happens and her luck is changed forever. Next thing you know she&rsquo;s some sort of celebrity, making all sorts of obscene sums, hanging out with royalty and movie stars. It&rsquo;s a dream a lot of young artists have, something to sustain them during their early, lean years.<br />
The funny thing is, when you hear the &ldquo;rock stars&rdquo; talk about their climb to the top, the part they invariably speak most fondly of is not the part with all the fame, money, and parties. It&rsquo;s the part before they made it, back when they were living in a basement without electricity and &ldquo;eating dog food,&rdquo; back when they were doing their breakthrough work.</p>

<p>Some years ago, after he&rsquo;d been playing stadiums for a while, the rock singer Neil Young was booed off the stage by his fans when he tried playing new country-and-western material. They didn&rsquo;t want to share in his new adventures. No, they had paid their money to hear the classic rock, dammit. &ldquo;Down by the River&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heart of Gold,&rdquo; dammit. And if they didn&rsquo;t get it, dammit, they&rsquo;d be out for blood. As events proved.<br />
It&rsquo;s hard to invent a new language when a lot of people are already heavily invested in your work (including yourself). When a lot of people are already fluent in the language you&rsquo;re currently speaking, and they don&rsquo;t want anything new from you. Like the Neil Young fans, they don&rsquo;t want to see your metaphorical new movie, they just want to watch the sequel to the old one.<br />
And success needs lots of people to keep the show on the road. When it&rsquo;s just you, a dream, and a few cans of dog food, there&rsquo;s only one person to worry about. But when the dream turns into reality, there&rsquo;s all sorts of other people suddenly needing to be taken care of, in order to keep the engine running. Publishers, investors, managers, journalists, retailers, suppliers, groupies, employees, accountants, family members . . . and the paying customers. They all have a stake in your act, and they all want a piece of the action.<br />
So you crank out another sequel and wait for the money to roll in. It&rsquo;s a living.<br />
Of course, one reason the rock stars can speak of their basement-and-dog-food era so fondly is because it eventually came to an end; it didn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>

<p>The ease with which a blog (or whatever social medium you prefer) can circumvent the gatekeepers is staggering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your book has thirteen chapters,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Voil&agrave;! That&rsquo;s thirteen blog posts. One chapter per blog post. Put it online, and you&rsquo;ll have a book offer within six months. Trust me.&rdquo;<br />
Of course, this is not how you do it in Paris, supposedly. You do it by going to all the right parties and hobnobbing with all the right people, supposedly. If you&rsquo;re good at it, you get a book deal, supposedly. If you&rsquo;re really good at it, they&rsquo;ll also let you go on the highbrow TV talk show circuit and pontificate about &ldquo;Culture&rdquo; with all the other erudite culture vultures, supposedly. Maybe give you an occasional column in Le Figaro, supposedly. An intoxicating combo of both intellectual celebrity and bourgeois respectability, supposedly. Very elite, supposedly. Very French, supposedly.</p>

<p>Whatever. If I were Marie, I would still reconsider blogging the book in full. And I would post up an English version as well, to give the book the greatest chance of being read by people outside her French, urban microcosm. Sure, the Parisian literary purists will bitch and moan, but hey, they&rsquo;re Parisian literary purists&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to bitch and moan anyway.</p>

<p>And of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t limit this advice just to writers. If I were a painter, I wouldn&rsquo;t move to New York and wait tables for ten years, trying to find an art gallery to represent me. I would just post the paintings online, build up a large enough audience, and eventually the sales will come.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But given a choice between two paths, both valid, how do you know which one to take? How do you know which one has the meaningful payoff?<br />
The answer, of course, is that you don&rsquo;t. Whether we&rsquo;re talking about moving to New York to become an &ldquo;Art Star,&rdquo; or opening up a humble coffee shop in Alpine, Texas, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;adventures.&rdquo; Because you don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to end.</p>

<p>Birth, sickness, death, falling in love, watching TV, raising families, mowing the lawn, going to the movies, taking your nephew to a ball game, drinking beer, hanging out with your buddies, playing Frisbee on the beach, painting the house, tending the garden. No matter where your adventure takes you, most of what is truly meaningful is still to be found revolving around the mundane stuff you did before you embarked on your adventure. The stuff that&rsquo;ll still be going on long after you and I are both dead, long after our contribution to the world is forgotten.<br />
But often, one needs to have that big adventure before truly appreciating how utterly wonderful all that simple, mundane stuff actually is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of that; I&rsquo;m not ashamed, either. It just is.</p>

<p>Van Gogh once told his brother, &ldquo;No painting ever sells for as much as it cost the artist to make it.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>If you are successful, it&rsquo;ll never come from the direction you predicted. Same is true if you fail.</p>
