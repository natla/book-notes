        <h3>Introduction<br>
          Are You a Renaissance Soul?</h3>
        <p><strong>Isabella d'Este (1474–1539).</strong> It wasn't enough for this Renaissance woman to display her great political talent
          when she became the chief of state for the Italian city of Mantua upon the death of her husband.
          Isabella d'Este also founded a school for young women, established an impressive art collection,
          played the lute, and spoke Greek and Latin.</p>

          <h4>CAREER OPTIONS FOR THE RENAISSANCE SOUL</h4>
          <ul class="detail-list">

            <li>
              Two for one&#8212two jobs that may be pursued simultaneously and that often complement one another
              (i.e., banker/financial journalist, stay at home mom/activist)
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              A singular career path with improved life design to accommodate many interests
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p><em>Are bookstores and libraries like candy stores to you, places where wonderful and intriguing items
            are on display at every turn?</em></p>

        <h3>Part I<br>
          Claiming Your Renaissance Soul</h3>
        <p>...a life can look scattered and fragmented while it's unfolding but still go down in history as a smashing success.</p>
        <p>
          One particularly dynamic way to practice several interests at once is to combine them under one
          title&#8212what I call an <em>umbrella</em>. Take Dan. When Dan set out to create a second career after running a
          successful restaurant, his wife suggested he get trained as a social worker. After all, she knew that
          Dan wanted to help troubled kids. When his friends heard that Dan dreamed of finally spending time rock
          climbing and white-water rafting, they suggested he start a business to take outdoor enthusiasts on
          wilderness trips. Did Dan choose between these two career tracks? No! Instead, he is now the happy owner
          of a beautiful camp in wild northern Maine, where he can share the outdoor activities he loves with
          paying customers and inner-city kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others pursue their varied interests on a rotating basis. Betsy, with her love of gardening and quilting
          and helping others, changes her activities with the seasons. During the winter she makes unusual baby
          quilts to sell over the Internet. In early spring she offers quilting workshops for seniors, using
          materials specially adapted with Velcro for arthritic hands. From late spring through early fall she has
          a position developing outdoor gardening and landscaping projects with prisoners. Come late fall she
          again gives quilting workshops for seniors.
        </p>
        <p>Then there are Renaissance Souls who do just one thing at a time... until they move on to their next interest,
          so that each distinct passion reads like a chapter in a fascinating book.</p>
        <p><em>As a Renaissance Soul, it doesn't matter whether we engage in our multitude of interests simultaneously,
            on a rotating basis, or sequentially. What's important is that we honor our delight in variety, rather than
            forcing ourselves to choose just one thing.</em></p>
        <p>Not everyone will understand your desire to move on to new challenges. You can always remind these people of Leonardo da Vinci.
          Nowadays, he'd probably be considered a failure because he left the <i>The Last Supper</i> unfinished, or because he was satisfied
          simply with having designed a helicopter instead of having his flying machine mocked up, market tested, and sold to the public
          at a fifty percent markup.</p>
        <p>Those who focus on an exclusive pursuit or career track are often seen as the socially acceptable ducks of our culture,
          while those who delight in a diversity of passions can feel like the out-of-step swans in the children's story.</p>
        <p><em>The truth is that we all have more time than we think.</em></p>
        <div class="important">
          <h4>
            GIVE ME TIME!
          </h4>
          <ul class="detail-list">

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you're the kind of Renaissance Soul who gathers interests under one umbrella, it's possible to gain
          expert status as quickly as anyone else. You may remember the concept of umbrellas from the previous
          chapter: they are professions or hobbies with a single name that cover enough different activities to
          delight a Renaissance Soul for a long time. Consider the Renaissance Soul with a passion for documentary
          filmmaking. She can develop her reputation as an expert filmmaker&#8212while making films about all the other
          topics (high fashion, Roman history, subatomic physics) that fascinate her.</p>
        <p>I was able to happily hang on to a career running a bed-and-breakfast for almost a decade. <em>Under the umbrella of <q>innkeeper,</q>
            I could be a storyteller, interior decorator, publicity person, landscape gardener, gourmet breakfast
            chef, finance person, historian, travel guide, and workshop developer!</em>&#8212and I became enough of an expert
          that a major television network flew me across the country to share my knowledge with their viewers.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Renaissance Souls who
            enjoy stepping outside their routine to write, teach, demonstrate, or promote their business often
            discover a surprising result. We move into the realm of respected expert ahead of our more narrowly
            focused peers.</em>
        </p>
        <p>...there are employees who have been at a variety of companies, worked in a variety of different positions, maybe taken time off to travel
          or run their own business. In today's highly competitive, constantly changing work environment, more and more companies want
          people like this. Why? Because they are much more adept at listening for change and noticing what needs to be done differently
          and more creatively inside the department, the company, or even the market that the company is maneuvering within.</p>
        <p>
          <em>People who enjoy learning new languages and exploring many cultures are highly valued in the global
            economy.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Savvy Renaissance Souls learn to highlight this quality in their résumés. Instead of apologizing for their many talents,
          they say with confidence, “I can move from one role to another with ease.”</p>
        <p>To many employers, a varied, multidimensional résumé displays flexibility, not immaturity.
          Says Laurie Jadick, vice president for human resources at a major information technology
          firm, <q>If I [am considering] the <q>organization professional</q> and the professional who has built a
            variety of experiences into their dossier&#8212<em>even taking time off to study a language or paint</em>, I will
            look at the nontraditionalist first... To be an industry leader, a business needs to attract and
            hire people who have sought out change and embraced it and grown from it.</q></p>
        <p>
          Bernie Saunders, an organizational and leadership development consultant and coauthor of <i>Ten Steps to a
            Learning Organization</i>, notes that companies are increasingly willing to teach technical or other skills
          to applicants who offer an attractive mix of flexibility and openness to change. He believes that
          companies look for a <q>right attitude</q> toward challenge. When I asked him to describe this attitude, he
          gave an answer that should make Renaissance Souls smile: <q>a lot of agility, adaptability, a natural
            propensity toward curiosity, an insatiable appetite for that and this and this and that!</q>
        </p>
        <p>I made it to ‘the top' because over and over people saw that I have a very wide and deep experience in a lot of different areas.
          In today's complex and interrelated world, CEOs can't have a narrow base of knowledge: they have to understand and appreciate
          every aspect of the business and the world they're doing business in. Understanding the many facets of today's international
          and fast-changing workplace is critical. So who gets promoted? The person with the most diverse interests.</p>
        <p>By following his passions, Ric has become financially secure. He enjoys the outward trappings of success—a Manhattan apartment,
          a second home in the country—but he's most grateful for the freedom he enjoys. “Now I can do whatever I want,” he says. He can
          afford to be choosy, taking on only those law clients who interest him the most, and accepting invitations for only the most
          intriguing art auctions. He still sings and performs whenever he feels like it. And are you surprised to hear that he got a master's
          in social work and now has a small but thriving psychotherapy practice?</p>

        <h3>Part II<br>
          Thriving on Many Interests Without Feeling Scattered</h3>
        <p>...you will never be so uninterested in all the other options out there to be sure without the shadow of a doubt that your choices are the best ones.</p>
        <h4>The Power of Renaissance Focal Points</h4>
        <h4>THE ICE-CREAM SAMPLER</h4>
        <p>Emory, who clerked in a record store, knew what he wanted: to manage a nightclub. But he seemed to expect this new career to settle down on him like
          a mantle instead of his having to go out and make things happen for himself. At the same time, he had so many interests outside of his job that he
          never received satisfaction from any of them. His guitar sat in the corner calling to him, and his new marriage was wilting from inattention. Even though
          he loved how his body felt after exercising, he never latched on to a regular schedule and often skipped his workouts for weeks at a time. His friends
          grew tired of hearing about his big dream to live in Italy for three months and write a series of comic plays. Yes, and what about his friends? He wasn't
          seeing enough of them, either... </p>
        <p>Catherine? She sees her gift-shop business as one of those umbrellas I've mentioned before. Each of her four Focal Points is directed toward one umbrella
          (her store) while satisfying her interests in design (by creating enticing displays), sharing her knowledge (by conducting employee seminars), working
          with artists (by hunting down merchandise in their workshops), and basking in the spotlight (by handling her own publicity).</p>
        <p>...one of his current Renaissance Soul goals is <em>to have more hours in the day than things to do.</em></p>
        <p><em>Being a Renaissance Soul means I can pursue the infinity of interconnections.</em></p>

        <h3>Part III</br>
          Practical Realities:</br>
          Career Design for Pursuing Your Passions</h3>

        <p>We all know that a day job is something you do just for the money while you look to the rest of your life for satisfaction.
          Unfortunately, many Renaissance Souls design their lives this way: they look in the classified section or on the Internet for
          a paying position they feel they are “qualified” to do. Once those forty (or fifty, or sixty) hours per week are squared away,
          they then try to fit the rest of their interests around the edges. Initially they are optimistic and full of energy. But what happens?
          The pressures, politics, and personalities of that job use them up. By the end of the workweek, they have little energy left for the
          real passions they’d hoped to engage, often feeling demoralized and depressed.</p>
        <p>What I suggest instead is something I call a J-O-B. I spell the word out to remind Renaissance Souls that it is both <i>only</i>
          a job and <i>more</i> than a job.</p>
        <div class="important">
          <h4>FIVE CRITERIA FOR A J-O-B</h4>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Income or benefits</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Energy</strong><br> A J-O-B can help you conserve your energy, so that in your off-hours you have plenty of bounce to pursue your Focal Points.
              It's a less obvious point that a J-O-B can also balance your energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Time</strong><br> A J-O-B may save you time if you're allowed to read, make phone calls, or work on the computer while at your desk.
              Or maybe a J-O-B offers an easy commute that frees up an extra hour or two each day.</li>
            <li><strong>Training and equipment</strong><br> Don't sniff at the opportunity to get training on expensive equipment or to polish skills
              that you'll need for your Focal Point. Your current so-so day job might just become an excellent J-O-B if it offers
              access to language labs or sophisticated libraries, free computer classes, networking seminars, or other workshops.</li>
            <li><strong>Networking and publicity opportunities</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Begin by holding your job up to the J-O-B criteria listed. Does it meet the standard of two or three of the five criteria for a J-O-B?
          If not, the next step is to ask if your job could be made to do so with a little creative effort. Could you take advantage of equipment
          available at your office if you repurposed your lunch hour? Could you cultivate contacts in other departments who might have skills that
          would further one of your Focal Points? Could you arrive at work an hour later and stay an hour later to take advantage of your fresh morning
          energy each day to pursue your passions?</p>
        <p>Many Renaissance Souls... when they realize their identity rests with their Focal Points, they decide to stay on at their current position.
          As a job, it stinks. As a J-O-B, it gives them more money per hour than they might be able to make elsewhere. Or it frees their mind to focus
          on their Focal Points because they’ve been there so long they can practically perform their tasks in their sleep. It’s the opposite of golden handcuffs.
          The personalities and politics of the place become amusing rather than consuming, and they tend to suffer less from workaholism—all because
          <em>their identity has moved elsewhere.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Part V<br>
          Going Deeper</h3>
        <p>
          Another client I worked with recently, Jeanette, had a mother who rarely left home. Terrified of the
          world outside her house, Jeanette's mother focused all her energies on cooking and sewing for her
          family, as her mother had done before her. My client had seemingly broken that mold and was out in the
          world, working a demanding job. She saw little relation between her mother's world and her own until we
          discovered her mother's core expectation: <q>No one is supposed to be happier than poor, miserable me!</q>
          Mother was a victim of her agoraphobia, and all her children were to be victims of something also. So
          when Jeanette came to me, she could rattle off a litany of all the terrible things that were going on at
          work, and how unfair it all was, and how she couldn't change jobs because she was trapped for this and
          that reason. She could talk happily for hours about things she would have liked to do, if only she'd
          been luckier. The idea of actually changing any facet of her life, however, was clearly taboo. It was
          not surprising that, as Jeannette began to claim her Renaissance Soul, she found herself asking,
          <q>Margaret, why is it that I just can't seem to get started?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Those, for example, who feel that success brings envy or false friends may often unconsciously limit
          their Renaissance Focal Points to things they know they won't be wildly (and dangerously) successful at.
