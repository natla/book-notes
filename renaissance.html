                <li>
                    Two for one&#8212two jobs that may be pursued simultaneously and that often complement one another
                    (i.e., banker/financial journalist, stay at home mom/activist)

            <p>
                One particularly dynamic way to practice several interests at once is to combine them under one
                title&#8212what I call an umbrella. Take Dan. When Dan set out to create a second career after running a
                successful restaurant, his wife suggested he get trained as a social worker. After all, she knew that
                Dan wanted to help troubled kids. When his friends heard that Dan dreamed of finally spending time rock
                climbing and white-water rafting, they suggested he start a business to take outdoor enthusiasts on
                wilderness trips. Did Dan choose between these two career tracks? No! Instead, he is now the happy owner
                of a beautiful camp in wild northern Maine, where he can share the outdoor activities he loves with
                paying customers and inner-city kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Others pursue their varied interests on a rotating basis. Betsy, with her love of gardening and quilting
                and helping others, changes her activities with the seasons. During the winter she makes unusual baby
                quilts to sell over the Internet. In early spring she offers quilting workshops for seniors, using
                materials specially adapted with Velcro for arthritic hands. From late spring through early fall she has
                a position developing outdoor gardening and landscaping projects with prisoners. Come late fall she
                again gives quilting workshops for seniors.

            <p>
                If you're the kind of Renaissance Soul who gathers interests under one umbrella, it's possible to gain
                expert status as quickly as anyone else. You may remember the concept of umbrellas from the previous
                chapter: they are professions or hobbies with a single name that cover enough different activities to
                delight a Renaissance Soul for a long time. Consider the Renaissance Soul with a passion for documentary
                filmmaking. She can develop her reputation as an expert filmmaker&#8212while making films about all the other
                topics (high fashion, Roman history, subatomic physics) that fascinate her. I was able to happily hang
                on to a career running a bed-and-breakfast for almost a decade. Under the umbrella of <q>innkeeper,</q> I
                could be a storyteller, interior decorator, publicity person, landscape gardener, gourmet breakfast
                chef, finance person, historian, travel guide, and workshop developer!&#8212and I became enough of an expert
                that a major television network flew me across the country to share my knowledge with their viewers.</p>
            <p>
                Remember, too, that expert status is not automatically conferred on anyone who pursues one single
                interest. There are many, many secretaries and plumbers and travel agents and cello players who do one
                thing their entire life without gaining any particular recognition as experts in their field. Expertise
                comes when a person is so turned on that he'll go that extra mile or risk trying a new idea. I would
                have been just one innkeeper among hundreds if I hadn't thought to develop the first national
                apprenticeship program for prospective bed-and-breakfast owners. The fact that I had as much <q>ham</q> in me
                as hostess allowed me to thrive on the public speaking opportunities that other innkeepers, wired more
                like Mozart, saw only as distractions to be avoided as much as possible. In fact, Renaissance Souls who
                enjoy stepping outside their routine to write, teach, demonstrate, or promote their business often
                discover a surprising result. We move into the realm of respected expert ahead of our more narrowly
                focused peers.

                People who enjoy learning new languages and exploring many cultures are highly valued in the global
                economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Savvy Renaissance Souls learn to highlight this quality in their resumes. Instead of apologizing for
                their many talents, they say with confidence, <q>I can move from one role to another with ease.</q>
                Department of Labor statistics predict that the current crop of college graduates will change jobs
                between eight and ten times over the course of a lifetime; many will cross from one field to another at
                least once or twice. To many employers, a varied, multidimensional resume displays flexibility, not
                immaturity. Says Laurie Jadick, vice president for human resources at a major information technology
                firm, <q>If I [am considering] the <q>organization professional</q> and the professional who has built a
                variety of experiences into their dossier&#8212even taking time off to study a language or paint, I will
                look at the nontraditionalist first. . . . To be an industry leader, a business needs to attract and
                hire people who have sought out change and embraced it and grown from it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bernie Saunders, an organizational and leadership development consultant and coauthor of Ten Steps to a
                Learning Organization, notes that companies are increasingly willing to teach technical or other skills
                to applicants who offer an attractive mix of flexibility and openness to change. He believes that
                companies look for a <q>right attitude</q> toward challenge. When I asked him to describe this attitude, he
                gave an answer that should make Renaissance Souls smile: <q>a lot of agility, adaptability, a natural
                propensity toward curiosity, an insatiable appetite for that and this and this and that!</q>

             <h3>Part III</br>
            Practical Realities:</br>
            Career Design for Pursuing Your Passions</h3>

            <p>
                Another client I worked with recently, Jeanette, had a mother who rarely left home. Terrified of the
                world outside her house, Jeanette's mother focused all her energies on cooking and sewing for her
                family, as her mother had done before her. My client had seemingly broken that mold and was out in the
                world, working a demanding job. She saw little relation between her mother's world and her own until we
                discovered her mother's core expectation: <q>No one is supposed to be happier than poor, miserable me!</q>
                Mother was a victim of her agoraphobia, and all her children were to be victims of something also. So
                when Jeanette came to me, she could rattle off a litany of all the terrible things that were going on at
                work, and how unfair it all was, and how she couldn't change jobs because she was trapped for this and
                that reason. She could talk happily for hours about things she would have liked to do, if only she'd
                been luckier. The idea of actually changing any facet of her life, however, was clearly taboo. It was
                not surprising that, as Jeannette began to claim her Renaissance Soul, she found herself asking,
                <q>Margaret, why is it that I just can't seem to get started?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Those, for example, who feel that success brings envy or false friends may often unconsciously limit
                their Renaissance Focal Points to things they know they won't be wildly (and dangerously) successful at.
