            <h3>Margaret Lobenstine 2006</h3>  --> 
        <p>I was inspired initially to write <cite>The Hero Within</cite> out of a concern that we would not be able to solve the great political, social, and philosophical problems of our time if so many of us persisted in seeing the hero as &ldquo;out there&rdquo; or &ldquo;up there,&rdquo; beyond ourselves. The book was meant as a call to the quest, a challenge to readers to claim their own heroism and take their own journeys.</p>

<p>Faced with homelessness in the streets, neglected children in our homes, and a growing discrepancy between the incomes of not only the rich and the poor, but the rich and the middle class, we never have needed the Altruist more than we do today.</p>

<p>The hero finds the treasure and recaptures innocence and then, as the Magician, transforms the kingdom. What this means is that <em>we do not transform the world in order to be happy. We find happiness first, and then we transform our world.</em></p>

<p>Although they [heroes] may feel very alone during the quest, at its end their reward is a sense of community: with themselves, with other people, and with the earth.</p>

<p>In fact, <em>any time you identify a wasteland element in your life&mdash;illness, boredom, lethargy, alienation, emptiness, loss, addiction, failure, anger, or outrage&mdash;it is time to take a journey. You can be called to the quest by such dissatisfaction or simply by a desire for adventure. The journey you take inevitably will transform you.</em> Systems theory tells us that when any element of a system changes, the whole system has to reconfigure. Therefore, simply by experiencing your own metamorphosis, you can contribute to the transformation of all the social systems of which you are a part: family, school, workplace, community, and society as a whole.</p>

<p class="important">The very nature of heroism requires us to face the dragon, not sit around and complain that dragons exist and someone should do something about them.</p>

<p>Actually, the heroic part of each of us fundamentally does not mind that the world is imperfect. This part does not live for comfort; it loves a good adventure.</p>

<p>Many people subscribe to the false idea that being heroic means you have to suffer and struggle to prevail. The fact is, most of us will experience difficulty whether or not we claim the heroic potential within us. Moreover, if we avoid our journeys, we also may feel bored and empty. It is not so much that we take our journeys in order to attain happiness. Rather, when we follow our real bliss, our journeys <i>are</i> our treasures.</p>

<p>People then excuse their own misdeeds, saying, &ldquo;Everyone does it,&rdquo; because they do not believe they make a difference.</p>

<p>Groups can discourage people from taking themselves seriously because they want to maintain group solidarity. The fear is that the heroic journey encourages individualism (which it does), so that heroes will not be loyal to the group. In fact, people who are on their journeys can be excellent group members because they are willing to stand their ground against the lowest-common-denominator tendency of group thinking. Groups in which people recite the party line tend to operate at an intelligence level well below that of the individuals involved. However, when a group encourages its members to share their real wisdom, the collective intelligence is likely to surpass that of any individual.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is important to remember that heroism is not the same as celebrity. No matter how much we enjoy following the lives of the rich and famous, we know that the world is affected more deeply by quiet, even invisible acts of integrity, kindness, and generosity than by fame and fortune.</p>

<p>Anytime we say that &ldquo;someone should do something about&rdquo; whatever problem is bothering us, we are giving away our own heroic power.</p>

<p class="important">&ldquo;The way you are today is just one stage of your journey. It is not how you will always be. You are not how you appear. You are a hero on a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You also may notice that every time you take the risk to be true to your own soul&mdash;whether or not you name your action as heroic&mdash;your example helps others to do likewise. &#8230; We can do nothing better for others than model the authentic life.</p>

<p>When we strike out to face the unknown, it is quite natural to experience a combination of terror and exhilaration. In some versions of the ancient Grail stories, the seeker gets to a point at the top of a mountain from which the Grail castle can be seen off&#160;in the distance. There does not appear to be any way across. The hero looks down into the chasm below, which goes down for miles. He looks across to the other side, realizing that the space is much too wide to jump. Then he remembers an ancient Grail teaching that says to step out in faith. As he puts one foot out into what appears to be empty space, a bridge suddenly appears and he is saved. Similarly, when the Israelites, who were slaves in Egypt, left to find the promised land, the Red Sea parted, but not before Moses (and his sister, Miriam) stepped bravely forward, trusting they would not drown.<br />
These stories sound very exotic and unlike our everyday lives, but they share in mythological language experiences that we all have. Anyone who has ever left a job or even school not knowing what would come next has put his or her foot out into the abyss. The same is true when we leave relationships that are not working for us; we leave not knowing if, or when, we will ever love again. It even is true when we let go of ideas that are not working, allowing ourselves to risk the terror of uncertainty until a new truth emerges.</p>

<p><i>When an archetype is activated in your life, it provides a structure that makes immediate growth possible.</i></p>

<p>I remember as a child playing a game called &ldquo;Chutes and Ladders.&rdquo; Players rolled the dice and then moved ahead slowly and incrementally, inching through the number of spaces thrown&mdash;except, of course, if you landed on a ladder or a chute. The ladder zoomed you toward the finish line with delightful speed, while the chute ruthlessly shot you back toward the starting line, undoing your former progress. Recently, I saw a science fiction film about wormholes in the universe, cosmic shortcuts through which a spaceship can move through space much faster than the speed of light.<br />
Both of these examples can help us understand how archetypes work. If I want to develop courage, I can try persistently, gradually taking greater risks and incrementally becoming less afraid. Or I can call up the Warrior archetype within me (who offers me&#160;the power of the ladder or the wormhole). That Warrior, an inner ally, is in touch with the accumulated fighting power of all the warriors who ever have been. Put another way, that inner archetypal Warrior holds the full potential of the Warrior as evidenced in my time. Although I still may have to learn skill, practice discipline, and differentiate between courage and bravado, through the archetype I can gain the Warrior&rsquo;s gifts much faster than if that archetype did not already exist within me.</p>

<p>Recognizing archetypes can help you achieve balance and personal fulfillment. Anytime we feel our lives are out of balance, it means that the archetype or archetypes currently dominating our behavior no longer coincide with those active in our inner lives. To correct our course, we can go inward and observe the yearnings&#160;that are our first indication that some new aspect of consciousness wants to be expressed. For instance, perhaps the Altruist archetype has been dominant in your life for some time. At first, you gained great satisfaction from giving to others. Now, however, some part of you feels dissatisfied. You wonder when it will be your turn. Your Wanderer wants time for self-exploration, creative expression, and just hanging out. Listening to that inner voice allows you to adjust your behavior to more accurately reflect your inner truth.<br />
When your outer behavior matches the archetypes active within, you will feel a sense of meaning and fulfillment and no longer experience your life as out of balance.</p>

<p>Awareness of the archetypal plot lines that determine your life can give you the freedom to avoid making mistakes&mdash;or making the&#160;same mistakes over and over. Perhaps the Orphan archetype has been activated in your life many times. You have been abandoned, betrayed, and victimized. As a result, you have become very cautious. You enter a situation and get that old feeling. Quickly you recognize that you are about to get conned. Now you simply walk away and refuse to play! Or if you don&rsquo;t, at least you notice more consciously than before the pattern of victimization that unfolds. Noticing this allows you to walk away the next time. <em>At some point, when the cosmos offers us one more similar challenge, we can say no&mdash;refuse the date, the job, the friendship and move on down the road to learn a new lesson.</em></p>

<p><em>We can reenter an archetypally similar situation as many times as it takes to move to a higher level of the archetype.</em> The gift for me of taking several jobs in organizations with Altruist values is that I was forced to learn boundaries and to give no more than is suitable for me. I also had to learn not to care overly much if others held it against me when I refused to sacrifice myself unnecessarily for their benefit.</p>

<p>Archetypal recognition can help you better understand others and how they see the world. &#8230; If I try to share with my husband and he always has to have the last word, it helps me to realize that the Warrior is present. Rather than trying to change him, I might remind him that we are on the same team&mdash;and we succeed or fail together. Thus, he has no reason to triumph at my expense.</p>

<p>Appreciating archetypal difference is extremely useful in dealing with very difficult people. For example, if your mother-in-law drives you crazy because she engages in nonstop complaining, you may see in her the negative aspects of the Orphan (self-pity) and the Altruist (giving beyond her means and then getting bitter about it). You may not be able to change her behavior completely, but you can do active listening to show her you hear her pain and also thank her profusely every time she does something for you.</p>

<p>The more archetypes that are activated in your life, the more truth you are able to understand.</p>

<p>It is no disgrace to try a single path as many times as you need, for there is only one test of a true path&mdash;that it brings you joy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2<br />
Surviving Difficulty: From the Innocent to the Orphan</h3>

<p>First we must fall from innocence so that later we can return to it at a more sophisticated and less childish level.</p>

<p>There is a certain level of danger inherent in the hero&rsquo;s journey that awakens our souls. The ego desperately wants safety. The soul wants to live. The truth is, we cannot lead a real life without risk. We do not develop depth without pain.<br />
Many people have told me that all their life decisions have had the single goal of keeping safe. Inside, they feel empty because they are not living their lives fully. Then something happens. They are diagnosed with cancer, their child dies, their spouse leaves, or that seemingly secure job is eliminated&mdash;and suddenly they realize that they cannot escape life. As they become more conscious, they often conclude that nothing they feared was actually as painful as the inner despair they experienced when they were holding back from living their lives.<br />
When we try to avoid the journey, it captures us.</p>

<p>&#8230;if you frequently feel powerless and do not know where to turn, it may be important to seek help going through the Orphan phase of the journey. Ideally, none of us should have to experience our pain alone. Indeed, it is part of the gift of the Orphan to accept that we all are wounded and we all are partial. Therefore, we need each other&mdash;not only because we want comfort and support, but also because each of us has a piece of the puzzle and no one has all the answers.&#160;<br />
Too many people today are arrested at the more primitive manifestations of the Orphan archetype because they are unable to acknowledge to themselves and to others how and when they feel powerless, or lack skills, or need assistance.</p>

<p>The Orphan is a disappointed idealist, and the higher the ideals about the world, the worse reality appears. Feeling like an orphan after the Fall is an exceptionally difficult mode. The world appears dangerous; villains and pitfalls are everywhere. Like a damsel in distress, the Orphan must cope with a hostile environment without&#160;appropriate strength or skills. It seems to be a dog-eat-dog world, where people are either victims or victimizers. Even villainous behavior may be justified as simply realistic, because the operative rule is &ldquo;Do unto others before they do unto you.&rdquo; The dominant emotion of this worldview is fear and its basic motivation is survival.<br />
This stage is so painful that people often escape from it by using various opiates: drugs, alcohol, work, consumerism, mindless pleasure. Or they may misuse relationships, work, or religion as a means to dull the pain and provide a spurious sense of safety. Ironically, such addictions have the side effect of increasing our sense of powerlessness and negativity; in the case of drugs and alcohol, they even foster distrust and paranoia.</p>

<p>The Orphan&rsquo;s task is to move out of innocence and denial and learn that suffering, pain, scarcity, and death are an inevitable part of life. The anger and pain this engenders will be proportional to one&rsquo;s initial illusions. This Fall leads to realism, because the job of the Orphan is to develop realistic expectations about life. When people give up their original childlike expectations, they are likely to go to the other extreme and expect too little from life.</p>

<p>After the Fall comes the long and sometimes slow climb back to trust and hope. The Orphan eventually must learn enough self-reliance to hold out against temptations to stay in negative or dehumanizing conditions. Most often, that cannot be done until we embark on a search for someone to take care of us. &ldquo;Maybe there is no one, now, who will watch over me, but perhaps I can find someone.&rdquo; Some women look for a Big Daddy; some men look for the perfect nurturing wife; many look for the great political leader, the movement, the cause, or the million-dollar deal that will make everything all right. Virtually everyone fantasizes about winning the lottery.</p>

<p>The successful resolution of the Orphan dilemma often depends on getting over the child&rsquo;s sense of entitlement. If I believe I was entitled to a happy childhood and I did not have one, I can spend the rest of my life feeling cheated and never get on with living. If I believe I have a right to a perfect life, any hardship can leave me bitter and unhappy.</p>

<p class="important">If we do not express the positive side of an archetype, it can take us over, but in its negative form.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, the real heroic response of the Orphan experiencing the Fall is to feel our own pain, disappointment, and loss&mdash;that is, to accept being an Orphan. This requires real grieving and an honest admission that we need others in our life. It ultimately is more heroic to risk acknowledging that &ldquo;I am in pain and I do not know what to do&rdquo; than to bluff and/or take our disappointment out on others.<br />
Some years ago, I was on staff at a workshop with a psychotherapist who did deep cathartic work with participants. We cried, beat on pillows, and told the stories of the ways we had been disappointed, used, and victimized and how we felt needy and powerless. This was empowering because we lost our fear of going into our pain or rage. It did not need to seem so big anymore. We also learned that we did not have to repress our pain or act out that rage on others. Expressing it in safe surroundings was enough.<br />
Like many other helping professionals, I discovered subsequently that people, particularly those with abusive backgrounds, do not necessarily have to relive every trauma they have experienced. Doing so is just too painful. It is enough to get beyond denial to express the pain they still feel. Then it is possible to experience their genuine feelings now, in the moment, without holding their breath for fear of lapsing back into intolerable feelings of terror, sadness, or despair. Reliving everything can retraumatize people. In such instances, being able to remind oneself that &ldquo;that was then and this is now&rdquo; can allow the journey to proceed and other inner allies to surface.</p>

<p>We move on to other stages of the journey when we develop a genuine, grounded, and realistic sense of hope.</p>

<p>If we are lucky, our parents, teachers, and friends helped us to:<br />
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>recognize the difference between tempters and guides;</li>
<li>distinguish between safe and unsafe environments;</li>
<li>develop an appropriate balance between skepticism and openness;</li>
<li>know how to ask for help in ways that increase the likelihood that it will be forthcoming;</li>
<li>recognize the appropriate balance of give and take in personal and business relationships;</li>
<li>learn from our mistakes without blaming ourselves for making them;</li>
<li>expect to be treated well and have enough empathy for others to reciprocate in kind; and</li>
<li>avoid traumatizing situations, or recover from them quickly if they occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once people overcome denial and face the reality of their lives, the next danger is despair. Warriors might be utterly frustrated that Orphans do not take their lives into their own hands, but many of us are not ready to do so. What keeps people alive when they have little to live for is simply the hope of rescue. It is&#160;no use telling those who feel powerless to grow up and take responsibility for their lives if they do not believe they are capable of it! First they must be provided with some hope that they&#160;will&#160;be cared for.</p>

<p>It is the hope that love or riches (or both) might be possible that frequently gets people to embark upon a quest. The &ldquo;savior&rdquo; can be a lover&#160;or&#160;it can be a business venture, a job, or professional training that might allow us to make enough money to purchase a sense of total security and control over our lives. The promise is that never again will we have to experience that terrible sense of powerlessness, of having needs&mdash;deep-seated survival needs&mdash;and being unable to meet them.&#160;</p>

<p>When the Orphan archetype is active in our lives, we desperately want teachers who know all the answers; as patients, we want doctors or therapists to be all-wise and all-knowing and to &ldquo;make it all better&rdquo;; as lovers, we want to find the perfect mate and have a relationship that makes us happy without having to work at it. In our theology, we want to believe that if we are good, God will take care of us; if we meditate enough, we will have peace; or if we follow the rules, we will be safe. In our politics, we hope for a great leader, a compelling movement, a dynamic political party that will take care of our country&rsquo;s problems. As consumers, we are attracted by products that promise the quick fix: use this detergent and you will be a good mother; drive this car and gorgeous women will climb all over you; try this diet and men will find you irresistible.<br />
It also is helpful to remember that no matter how sophisticated our thinking may be in other parts of our lives, in the part that wants rescue we will be at a fairly rudimentary level of cognitive development marked by absolutism and dualistic thinking.</p>

<p>The reality is, people who take on rescuing roles really are Orphans too, on the inside. Playing the part of savior is a way of pretending that it is others, not themselves, who are troubled. You can recognize people like this because very quickly they begin to undermine your self-esteem, so that you will remain dependent on them. Typically, they play on your fears: without this religion, this form of therapy, this political movement, you will be lost in sin, hopelessly sick, or overrun by communists (or fascists or chaos).<br />
Some men who initially seem dedicated to rescue eventually convince wives and girlfriends that no one else ever will love them and that they never could make it in the world on their own. Some women similarly convince husbands and boyfriends that they are so disgusting and impossible that no one else would put up with them. In such relationships, emotional abuse frequently escalates into violence.<br />
In the ethics of care it is important to make certain that the rescuer is not using another to avoid his or her own pain. Supervision, support groups, and similar mechanisms that allow others to be privy to what is going on between the helper and the person being helped are critical in stopping such dysfunctional patterns.<br />
No persons should be counseling others unless they (1) have been seriously engaged in doing their own work over time and (2) admit to being peers on the journey and share their own vulnerabilities. In fact, it is particularly helpful when dealing with Orphan issues to do so in peer groups or with the support of friends who also share their own vulnerabilities and pains. This decreases the chance that we will project the role of savior onto anyone and allows us to learn that everyone has strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>To move beyond the Orphan state of the journey, one first must fully&#160;be&#160;in it, and that means confronting one&rsquo;s own pain, despair, and cynicism. It also means mourning the loss of Eden, letting oneself know that there is no safety, that God (at least the childish notion of a &ldquo;Daddy God&rdquo;) is dead. </p>

<p>We can face our pain only in proportion to our hope. </p>

<p>Believing that our suffering is our own fault is&#160;not&#160;helpful if it fails to give us a handle on how to do something about the situation. In such a case, it leads us to conclude that our pain is justified, so we stay in it longer than necessary.</p>

<p>None of us can hold out against the pressure to work inhumanly long hours if we consciously or unconsciously believe we are inadequate, that we&#160;should&#160;be able to take the stress.</p>

<p>&#8230;some people ask for what they want by complaining. They know no other way.</p>

<p>If you tend to blame yourself for your pain, temporarily relying on someone outside&mdash;a higher power, a therapist, an analyst, a group, a movement, a church&mdash;can help you move beyond the dualism of dependence/independence and gradually gain the skills to take charge of your life. You do not have to do it all yourself, nor do you need to wait passively for rescue or accept mistreatment from anyone. There is no shame in asking for help when you need it. All really well-adjusted people do so.<br />
You also can protect yourself from being used or conned in such situations simply by noticing whether the expert you have chosen helps you make decisions or tries to make them for you. Good interventions (by this I mean any action a therapist takes that helps you) will strengthen and empower you, not take your journey out of your hands.<br />
Putting yourself in the therapist&rsquo;s, priest&rsquo;s, or guru&rsquo;s hands or placing your trust in a program (for instance, a twelve-step program) can provide the security to start moving and get your life in order. Later, however, you will look back and realize that if the intervention worked, it was because you were supported to make the decisions that fit for who you are. Remember Glinda, the good witch in The Wizard of Oz, who tells Dorothy at the end of her journey that she could have gone home any time she wanted to? Dorothy asks why she did not tell her that before, and Glinda explains that Dorothy would not have believed her. First she had to convince Dorothy that there was a great and powerful wizard who could fix things for her. In journeying to find him, Dorothy developed and experienced her competence. Later, she realized that she was able to kill the Wicked Witch herself, and it was her own power that would get her home. Until she had experienced these things, however, she would have felt too powerless to proceed except under the illusion that she was about to be rescued.</p>

<p class="important">The essential tools for empowering Orphans are: (1) love&mdash;an individual or a group who shows care and concern; (2) an opportunity to tell and retell their story in a way that overcomes denial (recounting how painful it was before they were saved, stopped drinking, became liberated, left their family of origin, etc.); (3) an analysis that moves the locus of the blame outside the individual, that says the fault lies elsewhere; and (4) a program of action to help them take responsibility for their own lives.</p>

<p>It also is my experience that when I have a hard time letting go of pain or anger about some past injustice or trauma, likely some more subtle form of it is still going on. For example, if you are angry because a former husband treated you disrespectfully and you just cannot let it go, look to your current relationships. Is there somewhere you are being treated similarly&mdash;even in a less obvious way? As we develop better boundaries and more effective ways of being treated well, it is surprising how fast we stop resonating to things that have hurt us in the past.</p>

<p>Once you have processed much of the pain, it is best to get on with life, even as you continue to tell your story. One key way is to focus on helping others, especially those who have had similar difficulties. Seeing how common such problems are fosters realism, while the act of helping moves you out of self-involvement into concern for the world. At this point, you are ready to proceed with the journey.</p>

<p>&#8230;the capacity to differentiate between suffering that is harmful and should be alleviated and suffering that is an inevitable part of growth and change.</p>

<p>Each time we become aware that we are suffering, it is a signal that we are ready to move on and make changes in our lives. Our task, then, is to explore the suffering, to be aware of it, to claim fully that we indeed are hurting. In this way, suffering can be a gift. It captures our attention and indicates that it is time for us to move on, to learn new behaviors, to try new challenges.</p>

<p>Similarly, in <cite>Death: The Final Stage of Growth</cite>, Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross recounts the peace and freedom felt by people who have been declared clinically dead and come back to life&mdash;how their experiences of love and light freed them from the fear of death that so interferes with most of our lives.<br />
How we deal with death, of course, is tied in with how we respond to all the little deaths in our lives&mdash;the loss of friends, family, lovers, of particularly special times and places, of jobs or opportunities, hopes and dreams, systems of belief. Interestingly, it often seems unnecessary to suffer in large ways if we learn the small, daily ways of giving to others and letting go of the present to meet the unknown. Some people need to face &ldquo;the worst&rdquo; to learn this lesson. Others do not. The dailiness of giving and letting go provides them with the skills they need to cope when a loved one dies or they find themselves critically ill.<br />
Some people block out these little deaths. They leave without saying good-bye. They graduate from high school or college and neither celebrate nor mourn the life that will be no more. They pretend that birthdays are just like any other day. It is as if there will not be a loss if they do not acknowledge it. Such people always must pick a fight to get out of a relationship or pretend it never meant anything to them. Those who block all their endings become so constipated emotionally that they have no room to let anything else in. They begin to feel uncomfortable and numb.<br />
Others who have gained more wisdom know that sometimes they must leave a relationship, a place, or a job because it is time&#160;to grow, to move on. They know that growing older holds new opportunities, but it also means the end of youth. Such people can celebrate the future and their new area of growth while fully acknowledging what it has meant to them to be with that person, in that job or school, or in that location. They can take time also to be thankful for what has been and to mourn its loss. This thanksgiving and mourning empties them out and makes way for the new. Having felt those feelings, they are ready for the excitement of new growth.</p>

<h4>GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE ORPHAN ARCHETYPE</h4>
<p>To familiarize yourself with the Orphan archetype, make a collage out of Orphan-like pictures from magazines; make lists of songs, movies, and books that express the Orphan; collect pictures of yourself, relatives, colleagues, and friends in an Orphan mode. Practice noticing when you are thinking or acting like an Orphan.</p>
<p><b>Orphan Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Develop the habit every day of letting yourself feel your feelings. When you feel lonely, mistreated, or bad in any way, reach out and share with others what you are feeling. You may not think you know how to do this, but start with the basics: &ldquo;mad,&rdquo; &ldquo;sad,&rdquo; &ldquo;glad,&rdquo; &ldquo;scared,&rdquo; and &ldquo;love.&rdquo; Your repertoire of feelings will develop as you practice this step. Let yourself be vulnerable. Ask others for their support and support them in kind.</p>
<p><i>Step Two:</i> Develop an awareness of your body so that you release emotions stored there. Massage, body work, yoga, and many kinds of exercise that encourage physical awareness can be helpful.</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> When you experience severe pain, frustration, or loss, take some time alone or with trusted friends to feel your feelings fully. Let out your tears, your rage, your fear by simply breathing in and then expressing whatever sounds or movements come. It is essential not to judge this process. Just allow your feelings and let them go. After they are expressed fully, find a way to restore yourself&mdash;take a ritual bath, lie on the earth and bathe in the sun or moon, eat your favorite meal. In the process, share what you experienced in your journal or with your friend. Then affirm that you are safe and loved!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 3<br />

<p>In fitness, they are likely to choose solitary exercise like long-distance running or swimming. As learners, they question the answers given by authorities and search out their own truths. Wanderers&rsquo; identities come from being outsiders. They are decidedly not team players. In their spiritual life, they may experience doubt, especially if they have been taught that God rewards a measure of conformity and traditional morality, qualities likely to be at variance with the needs of their developing, experimenting psyches. Yet the dark night of the soul they experience often leads to a more mature and adequate faith.</p>

<p>[Or the hero&mdash;especially if she is female&mdash;may be enchanted by a mirror, as is Alfred Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s Lady of Shalott (from the poem of the same name). Such an image, interpreted psychologically, suggests she is preoccupied with her appearance and with pleasing, rather than with what she sees and what pleases her.]</p>

<p>To the Altruist, the urge to the quest may seem selfish and therefore wrong, because it involves turning one&rsquo;s back on care and duty in the pursuit of self-discovery and self-actualization.</p>

<p>The pressure to conform, to do one&rsquo;s duty, to do what others want, is strong for both men and women, but it is stronger for women because their role has been defined in terms of nurturance and duty. Often women forbear taking their journeys because they fear it will hurt their husbands, fathers, mothers, children, or friends; yet women daily hurt others when they do&#160;not&#160;do so. Similarly, many men are trapped in their protector role and do not dare take their journeys because of a sense of responsibility not only to their children but to the wives who appear to be fragile and incapable of taking care of themselves. </p>

<p>The nice thing about Wanderers taking their journey is that it has a ripple effect, allowing loved ones and colleagues to take&#160;theirs as well.</p>

<p>However much people have learned about giving and letting go, their sacrifices will be for nothing unless they also learn who they are. It is not helpful to tell people to transcend their ego until they have developed one. It is not useful to tell people to transcend desire until they have allowed themselves to fully go for what they want.</p>

<p>One of the major addictions in our culture is to romance. This works because the culture has made sex and love artificially scarce commodities, leading people to spend endless hours trying to manipulate the world so they will get enough. We are taught that we need to conform to certain images of feminine and masculine behavior to be loved and to be thought of as sexually appealing. Yet, as long as we play roles rather than take our journeys, we never feel loved for ourselves and we never experience the power of truly intimate sexual connection. Thus, we may have lots of lovers but still feel empty, needy, and wanting something more.</p>

<p>Further, even their loving may ultimately be harmful to other people, for it is likely to be compulsive, proprietary, controlling, and dependent. Because their sense of identity comes from having (as in possessing) that child, that boyfriend, that girlfriend, they need that person to be a certain way. They need that person to stay around even if his or her own journey calls.<br />
The Orphan and the Altruist at their first levels of understanding, and sometimes even at the second, believe that to have love, they must compromise who they are. At some level, they believe that if they were fully to be themselves, they would end up alone, friendless, and poor.</p>

<p>In our culture, we tend to believe we can have intimacy&#160;or&#160;we can have autonomy and selfhood. So women tend to choose intimacy and men choose independence. The irony is that in choosing this way, neither really gets what she or he wants. For one thing, people really want both. For another, it is not possible to truly get one without the other.<br />
If we choose intimacy instead of independence, we cannot be fully&#160;ourselves&#160;in a relationship, because we have too much&#160;invested in keeping it; we play it &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; play a role, and wonder why we feel so alone. If, on the other hand, we choose independence, our need for intimacy does not go away. Indeed, because it is repressed and therefore unacknowledged and unexamined, it manifests itself in compulsive and uncontrolled urges and activities. Most men or women who believe in &ldquo;I-don&rsquo;t-need-anyone&rdquo; stoicism are dreadfully lonely. Many&mdash;while maintaining the illusion of self-sufficiency&mdash;are absolutely terrified of abandonment.<br />
Men in this state infantilize women, so that women (they believe) will not have the confidence to leave them. They want to keep their wives, if not barefoot and pregnant, at least without the skills and confidence needed to have a career that could support them well.</p>

<p>Wanderers confront the fear that they will be unable to survive alone and decide that whatever the cost in loneliness, isolation, even social ostracism, they will be themselves. ... Women tend to be so afraid of aloneness that they stay overlong in the Altruist mode; and of course this fear is accentuated by the cultural notion that to be alone and female is to be a failure (clearly you could not get a man).<br />
Men, on the other hand, are so enamored of independence that they get stuck there, since independence in our culture is practically a synonym for masculinity. Furthermore, their independence has an undercurrent of sadness to it, especially if they have sacrificed their need for love to their desire to be separate and whole.</p>

<h4>ALIENATION AND ESCAPE</h4>

<p>When the Wanderer archetype emerges in our life, we will feel cut off, even if we are never truly alone. We have many ways of finding solitude. One is actually to live alone, travel alone, spend our time alone. Relatively few people adopt this course for any extended period of time. Other ways have the advantage of masking our aloneness, sometimes even to ourselves. One is to discount what we feel, what we want, and to give others what we think they want: to be what&#160;<br />
we&#160;think they want us to be. Another is to treat people as objects for the gratification of our own desires. This requires that we allow ourselves no real awareness of their separate human identity. Actually, anytime someone acts in one-up/one-down roles with another person, that will be a solitary interaction.</p>

<p>Or we can continue living with our family if we don&rsquo;t get along with them; we can stay in a bad marriage; we can live with roommates with whom we have little in common. If we really are serious about being alone, we can decide that everyone is out to get us or to get something from us.</p>

<p>The very emptiness and vulnerability that result from such fearful approaches to life motivate many of us to take the action necessary to discover or create a self. Certainly, many people manage to be alienated and lonely all their lives without ever growing or changing, but others use these times to be &ldquo;secret heroes,&rdquo; thinking new thoughts and&#160;imagining new alternatives while on the surface they go about their normal lives as usual. A woman I know looks back on an eleven-year, extremely conventional and superficial marriage as a safe haven, a cocoon in which she hid while she prepared to soar. But when she was in the marriage, she did not know this. In fact, it was the intensification of her sense of emptiness in the traditional female role and loneliness in the marital relationship that was, by its very unpleasantness, her call to the quest. For many,&#160;alienation within captivity is the initial stage of wandering, followed by a conscious choice to embark on the journey.</p>

<p>When it is time to take the journey, Wanderers will feel alone whether or not they are married, have children and friends, or hold a prestigious job. They cannot avoid this experience. All their attempts to do so simply repress their awareness of where they are, so that they are slower to learn lessons and thus stay lonely longer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is unlikely that any of our attempts to break through to persons at this stage and be truly intimate with them will work. They will continue to set up barriers to intimacy because their developmental task is to confront being alone. Very few people, moreover, are conscious enough of their own patterns of growth to tell you that honestly. Most will say, &ldquo;Sure I want to be close,&rdquo; but then they sabotage intimacy. The only thing that really speeds them up is to become conscious that they are, in fact, alone.</p>

<p>Nothing can make you feel more alone than never being able to share your pain with another.</p>

<p>The hero&rsquo;s journey requires us to find our uniqueness. We simply cannot do that without enough solitude to find out who we are. Most of us need some time alone every day just to stay clear. </p>

<p>We will never know who we are and what we want if we just stay in our old ruts. This is why we must wander a bit to grow.<br />
This process of listening to our own desires and acting to fulfill them is fundamental to building an identity. We come into this world with a self, but it is more a potential than a fully developed identity.</p>

<p>Maybe she got married, quit her job, and had kids just because everyone else did.<br />
Actually, when she made those choices, she was not very experienced and not very clear about what she really wanted. Making them helped her become someone capable of better ones. <br />
... Perhaps she decides she does not want to be a wife because she married before she ever experimented with life and gained a sense of competence in the world. And if she is a mother, the odds are great that she will continue that responsibility whether or not she now feels ready for parenthood.<br />
Paradoxically, it is in resolving what sometimes seems an intolerable opposition between parental or professional responsibilities and personal exploration that people often find out more fully who they are. They come to know themselves moment by moment by the decisions they make, trying to reconcile their care for others with their responsibility to themselves. Maturity comes with that curious mixture of taking responsibility for our prior choices while being as imaginative as possible in finding ways to continue our journeys.</p>

<p>Wanderers do not learn their lessons all at once. Like all the archetypes, they learn an initial lesson and then circle back.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Wanderer ultimately teaches us to be ourselves&mdash;to be true to ourselves fully in every moment. This takes enormous discipline and requires that we stay in touch with our body, heart, mind, and soul all the time in every interaction.</p>

<h4>FLEEING THE CAPTOR</h4>

<p>While the pivotal person for Orphans is the rescuer, the transformative person or concept for Wanderers is the villain or captor.<br />
This is the stage of separation. Feminists who identify men as oppressors, people of color who see whites as the enemy, workers who hate their jobs and blame the companies or their bosses, working class and poor people who conclude that capitalists never can be trusted&mdash;all strive to live as separately from the oppressing groups as possible.<br />
In the Wanderer stage, men or women who feel trapped in their marriages initially might be able to justify divorce only if it can be established that their spouse is villainous. The only way they can leave their jobs is to convince themselves that their workplace is dysfunctional or their boss abusive.</p>

<p>Our job, then, is to leave them, actually or simply by distancing enough to claim ourselves. What is critical in either case is to stop postponing our journey for them.</p>

<p>Psychotherapy quite often encourages the Wanderer archetype. When clients are unhappy, the psychotherapist helps them see that their suffering results from the failures of their mothers (the bad queen) and/or their fathers (the bad king). The client is encouraged to make new and different decisions and to take his or her own journey. Such approaches, of course, work best if the client is stuck in Orphan or otherwise needs to awaken his or her inner Wanderer.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was complaining to me about a woman who comes to her for marital counseling. In spite of the fact that the woman&rsquo;s husband was a very sweet fellow who was willing to do just about anything to keep her and make her happy, this woman persisted in seeing him as a villain. The counselor was most irritated at her because, according to the counselor, the woman had a perfect opportunity for an extremely happy marriage. What my friend did not see was that her client could not have a happy marriage because as yet she was incapable of taking her own journey while staying with him. As long as they were together, she would compromise, try to please him, and in any number of ways do things that aborted her own quest. No matter how wonderful her husband was, he was a captor to her and she needed to take some time away until she had developed sufficient boundaries so that she could be with him and be herself at the same time.<br />
his is, of course, the same reason teenagers decide their parents are uptight, or oppressive, or that they just do not understand. Very few people feel justified in leaving anyone or anything&mdash;a parent, a child, a lover, a mentor, a job, a way of life&mdash;without coming to the conclusion that&#160;<br />
what they are leaving is bad. It is inconceivable just to want to leave because one needs to grow. The realization that one&rsquo;s rescuer always becomes an oppressor if one does not move on when it is time to do so comes later, if at all. As a rule of thumb, if someone else suddenly becomes hostile to you, or if ways of behaving that used to please this person do not anymore, it is useful to recognize that unless you have changed radically, the other person probably is changing and your relationship no longer fits. Your old friend or lover probably will need some distance from you. If you do not allow the distance, the other person will pick fights and make you the villain to enforce it.<br />
However, if you do allow separateness and decide to give the other person room to grow, it is very likely that eventually you will be rewarded with a new, deeper, and more honest relationship, or at worst with the knowledge that in letting go you did a good thing&mdash;for both of you. Even if you are terrified of being left, want to control those you love, and hence try to make them abort their journeys, it is best to pause, go back, face your fear and loneliness, process them,&#160;and let go.</p>

<p>Boundaries also are essential for finding our own vocations. Part of being human is being a creator, bringing into being things that were not here before. That&rsquo;s what it means to say we were created in God&rsquo;s image. Ayla, in her solitary valley, made and invented tools; she tamed a horse and a cave lion; she experimented with new medicinal recipes and new ways to dress and wear her hair. Only the discovery that she could survive alone freed her to be as creative and competent as she was able to be. By exploring her potential in this way, she not only created things and experiences outside herself, she discovered herself as someone to be proud of.</p>

<p>Then, one day, we accept loneliness and a sense of an existential void, sometimes felt in the solar plexus, as just the way things&#160;are: &ldquo;We all walk alone,&rdquo; we may say, &ldquo;each and every one of us.&rdquo; Fully accepting and feeling anything always sends us into another place. It is only struggling against our growth that locks us in. In this case, accepting loneliness leads to rebellion: those quiet or public experiments in acting on what you really want, loving who you really love, doing the work you care about, finding out who you are. Then the sense of enjoyment that Ayla discovers in her own company, in which solitude becomes something quite different from loneliness, creeps in. The more we are ourselves, the less alone we feel. We are never really alone when we have ourselves.</p>

<h4>COMMUNITY</h4>
<p>Thus, the movement into isolation and loneliness ultimately leads back to community&#8230;<br />
Many who have learned to embrace their independence and even aloneness find later that they miss human connection.&#160;They have become capable of experiencing intimacy at a new level because they have developed a strong enough sense of self that they are not afraid of being swallowed up in the other. To their surprise, they often find, just when they are ready, that people and communities exist that love them for exactly who they are.<br />
As they resolve the conflict between love and autonomy by choosing themselves without denying their yearning for connection, the seemingly impossible conflict dissolves. In this new way of seeing the world, the&#160;reward&#160;for being fully and wholly ourselves is love, respect, and community. But for most of us, the full enjoyment of this reward does not come until we gain the Warrior&rsquo;s ability to assert our own wishes in the relationship, the Altruist&rsquo;s capacity to give and to commit to others, and the Innocent&rsquo;s knowledge that there is no scarcity, that we can have all the love we need as our birthright. We do not have to&#160;pay&#160;for it by forfeiting our lives.</p>

<h4>GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE WANDERER ARCHETYPE</h4>
<p>To familiarize yourself with the Wanderer archetype, make a collage out of Wanderer-like pictures from magazines; make lists of songs, movies, and books that express the Wanderer; collect pictures of yourself, relatives, colleagues, and friends in a Wanderer mode. Practice noticing when you are thinking or acting like a Wanderer.</p>
<p><b>Wanderer Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Pay attention to the habits, experiences, activities, situations, and ideas that do not fit for you. They may be wrong, unhealthy, or limiting, or they may be fine for others but are not for you.</p>
<p><i>Step Two:</i> When you can, walk away from everything that is not right for you. If you cannot actually leave, then mentally distance, keeping your inner freedom. Begin imagining alternatives, envisioning the options that would be more appropriate for you.</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> As you say no to what is not right for you, allow your heart and your curiosity to push you to explore other possibilities. Look for experiences and ideas that feel congruent with who you are and what you want to know at this time in your life. Look for the people, places, and activities that resonate with your true essence and commit to them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4<br />
Proving Your Worth: The Warrior</h3>

<p>&#8230;the Warrior archetype protects the boundaries, so anyone without access to their Warrior is at risk of abuse, neglect, or being undervalued. The Warrior also is important because it helps all of us to stay connected to our primal desires. It helps us know what we want and then go forward to get it.</p>

<p>Yet many seemingly successful people today are finding out the truth in the saying, &ldquo;You can never get enough of what you do not want.&rdquo; We can have money, status, even apparent freedom, yet be miserable because we do not tap into our real hungers and yearnings.</p>

<p>If we have the courage to ask primal questions of ourselves, about what we desire at a gut level, the Warrior archetype can help us find the focus, skill, and drive to fulfill that desire.</p>

<p>Basic to Warrior energy is a sense of pride and dignity. The cowboy, insulted by the outlaw, meets him at high noon to settle the score. What is at stake is one&rsquo;s honor. To the Warrior, it is shameful to allow yourself to be disrespected. It also is dishonorable to allow someone else&mdash;especially someone weaker or defenseless&mdash;to be mistreated.</p>

<p>The Warrior, then, also is about internal discipline. This means that your inner Warrior helps you say no to temptation, cheating, laziness, or debauchery. It holds the boundaries against the more negative aspects of our sensory desires. Think of the seven deadly sins: sloth, gluttony, avarice, lust, wrath, pride, and envy.</p>

<p>If we think about the journey of the Orphan seeking rescue, we can appreciate the great advance that happens when people stop identifying with the victim to be rescued and begin identifying with the Warrior rescuer. How much more powerful one feels! Developmentally, the Warrior helps people take control of their lives and empowers them to help others as well as themselves. When you have access to your inner Warrior, you will do whatever you need to prevail.</p>

<p>People with a Warrior spirit who go to see a psychotherapist can be dumbfounded that they are encouraged not only to feel, but to share their feelings. Orphans need to learn to feel their feelings so they can move through them and let them go. Warriors strive to channel their feelings as a resource for their power, enabling them to perform the action best suited for achieving the goal, whether it be peace of mind, financial success, or desired familial bonds.</p>

<p>&#8230;when people have the courage to fight for themselves, they can affect their destinies.</p>

<p>When the hero does triumph over the villain, however, it reinforces&#160;our faith that it is possible not only to identify the dragon but to slay the beast: we can take charge of our lives, eliminate our problems, and make a better world. In doing so, we rescue the damsel in distress who is the Orphan in all of us. The Warrior says to the Orphan within: &ldquo;You do not always have to look for someone outside yourself to save you; I can take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the psychological level, it [warrior consciousness] has to do with the creation of healthy boundaries, so that we know where we end and other people begin, and an ability to assert ourselves.<br />
Intellectually, the Warrior helps us learn discrimination, to see which path, which ideas, which values are more useful and life-enhancing than others. On the spiritual level, it means learning to differentiate among theologies: to know which bring more life and which kill or maim the life force within us. The Warrior also helps us to speak out and to fight for what nourishes our minds, our hearts, and our souls, and to vanquish those things that sap and deplete the human spirit by speaking the truth about them and refusing to accept them or to allow them into our lives.</p>

<p>The development of warrioring capabilities is essential to a full life, and it is a necessary complement to the virtues associated with the Altruist. Initially, Altruists see themselves as sacrificing for others, while Warriors, at the relatively primitive level, assume that they need to slay others to protect themselves. Their willingness to do so is an important expression of commitment to themselves and their own self-worth; it is the fundamental assertion that they have a right to be here and to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p>&#8230;their belief that they do not have a right to be here unless they do serve&mdash;i.e., that they do not have a right to exist for their own sake. Many women can conceive of doing things just because they want to only after they have satisfied the needs and wishes of their children, their husbands, their bosses, their friends, and on and on. Because those demands never can be met entirely, anything they do for themselves is accompanied by guilt&mdash;even if what they are doing is attending to their basic health needs, like going out for a jog.</p>

<p>An adolescent boy feels oppressed by a father who seems strict and overbearing. The son complains that his father runs his life, evaluates his every move, and thinks he himself is always right. As the son&rsquo;s Warrior starts to develop, he argues with his father and sometimes even defies him. Eventually, however, his Warrior becomes more like an inner father. The son develops his own standards, imposes his own discipline on himself, and begins to achieve in academic and athletic endeavors. He then notices that his own father relaxes and does not have to control his every move. And when the son does disagree with the father, he says so calmly, sparking a dialogue, not a fight.<br />
If the father had not noticed and appreciated the growth of the boy&rsquo;s Warrior, he could have caused it to go underground by continuing his control over him after the boy was developed enough to show self-control. The boy might then begin to act out in self-destructive ways. If the father is Warrior-possessed, he may feel a compulsive need to compete, win, and be right&mdash;all the time.</p>

<p>&#8230;this archetype informs people&rsquo;s attempts to change their environments to suit their own needs and to conform to their values.<br />
However, people who move into warrioring before finding their own identities act out the form of the slaying-the-dragon plot, but without the meaning. They may win, but the victory is hollow. They do not know what they really want, so they cannot&#160;get it. Without the Altruist, the Warrior competes merely to gain personal advantage instead of to protect or help others. Indeed, the Warrior is a heroic archetype only when its courage and focus are employed for the greater good.</p>

<p>Even when the Warrior is well balanced with other archetypes, Warriors must be tough-minded and realistic if they hope to change the world. They need to be able to look their adversary in the eye and say, &ldquo;You are a dragon and I am going to slay you.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I do not care how you feel, I want to win and that means I have to defeat you.&rdquo; In the workplace, particularly, Warriors test co-workers to see if they are tough enough. This hazing can be&#160;unnerving to those with less Warrior in their psyches. However, its purpose is to make certain that the team is solid, with no wimps who will let the others down.</p>

<h4>ACHIEVING ARCHETYPAL BALANCE</h4>
<p>When any archetype is balanced with the others, it tends to be expressed in its higher, more integrated and positive form. <br />
Warriors who have access only to their Orphan and Wanderer can be ruthless. However, Warriors with developed Altruist archetypes fight in the service of others. If the Innocent and Magician archetypes also are awakened, their struggles are informed equally by spirituality. Soldiers may fight for their loved ones, their country, their religious&#160;convictions, and to make the world a better place. Political leaders, social activists, and concerned volunteers struggle to improve the lives of those around them. <br />
Gaining a more sophisticated level of skill at one allows the development of a more sophisticated level of skill at the other.</p>

<p>Orphans see themselves as victims, and Wanderers as outsiders. By defining themselves as having no power in the culture, they do not have to take any responsibility for it. To identify yourself as a Warrior is to say, &ldquo;I am responsible for what happens here&rdquo; and &ldquo;I must do what I can to make this a better world for myself and for others.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>BEYOND SLAYING THE DRAGON</h4>

<p>The woman who a few years ago would have lambasted a man for a sexist remark now says in a fairly bored and disinterested way, &ldquo;Oh, come off it.&rdquo; The stronger and more confident Warriors become, the less they must use violence, the more gentle they can be&mdash;with themselves and others. Finally, they need not define the other as villain, opponent, or even a potential convert; rather, the other becomes another possible hero, like themselves.<br />
That the Warrior&rsquo;s truth now is simply one among many does not preclude commitment&mdash;to ideals, people, causes, or beliefs. Even in a relativistic world, Warriors embrace their beliefs and understandings with their whole hearts. It is, therefore, a high-level achievement in the Warrior process for a seemingly antithetical [&#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1080;&#1074;&#1086;&#1087;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1078;&#1085;&#1072;] truth to be greeted not as an enemy, but as a potential friend: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my truth. I will explain it to you as fully as I can, and you can explain yours to me.&rdquo; The task of the hero, then, is to bridge, not to slay or convert.</p>

<p>&#8230;the mirror tells her that she is afraid &ldquo;because&#8230;no one else sees what you see, no one else can tell you if what you see is true.&rdquo; So she decides to trust herself.</p>

<p>Many years later, she realizes she is afraid of birthdays, and her mirror tells her, &ldquo;There is something you have always wanted to do which you have been afraid of doing and you know time is running out.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<h4>CELEBRATING EXCELLENCE</h4>

<p>In <cite>Care of the Soul</cite>, Jungian analyst Thomas Moore maintains that our souls find great satisfaction anytime we do our best.&#160;Such accomplishment can occur at work or at home. It may bring in income or it may be done for its own sake or as a gift to others. In either case, a quality product or service mirrors our souls and, in this way, reflects back to us our genuine worth. Therefore, you can find no better route to high self-esteem than a commitment to excellence in everything you do.<br />
Imagine a world in which every person believed that he or she mattered and could make a contribution that helps us all. Imagine that at home, at school, and in recreational activities, each child&rsquo;s gifts were recognized and developed.</p>

<h4>THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMILITY</h4>

<p>The Achilles&rsquo; heel of the Warrior is arrogance.</p>

<p>&#8230;he gave up and just surrendered to a mystic sense of trust in the universe and oneness that brings him exquisite joy.</p>

<p>Warriors who once felt such justifiable pride and exuberance [&#1078;&#1080;&#1079;&#1085;&#1077;&#1088;&#1072;&#1076;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;] over attaining the ability to take charge of their lives and make things happen years later begin to feel exhausted and drained.<br />
&#8230;a healthy desire to achieve has become obsessive and addictive.&#160;What they must do then is admit their ordinary human vulnerability and their need for love, for other people, and for spiritual and physical sustenance and nurturance.<br />
Warriors first develop confidence by proving their superiority to others, because they have taken more control over their own lives than most and can make things happen while others seem to wait passively for things to happen to them. One of the gifts, then,&#160;when control fails is the dawning recognition that fundamentally we are not that different from one another. We are all in the same boat, and we are all, ultimately, interdependent: we need other people; we need the earth; we need God.<br />
The only reason to want to be one up is a belief that it is not fine to be just ordinary. Previously, not being special or different was equated with the Orphan&rsquo;s powerlessness, and therefore seemed contemptible to Warriors. In recognizing oneness with the earth and interdependence with other people, they come to honor humanness in those who are in control of their lives as well as those who have given over control or had it wrested from them. When heroes give up the need to be &ldquo;better than,&rdquo; they stop having to prove themselves all the time and can, at least occasionally just&#160;be.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, Warriors must give over control of the outcome and assert themselves as part of the dance of life.<br />
It is then that miracles begin to happen. Often, after they have let go of their attachment to a particular outcome, when they have put themselves and their desires out there with no attendant wish to manipulate people or make people satisfy them, Warriors discover that the results are better than they dared hope. It is at this point that Buddhist notions of nonattachment and Judeo-Christian mystic beliefs about transcending ego begin to make sense and to be useful to the hero.</p>

<p>Symbolically, it is important that at the end of the old heroic myth, after he has confronted his fear by slaying the dragon, the&#160;Warrior comes home and marries. The reward for his battle is that he becomes, finally, a lover. Without the skills of assertion and boundary setting, no real peer love relationship is possible&mdash;only one in which one person simply conquers and the other appeases.&#160;These skills allow for the creation of a positive relationship with another human being, with institutions, and with the world in general. Ultimately, they make it possible to love and savor life itself.<br />
Many of the great lovers in literature begin by quarreling with one another&mdash;for example, Shakespeare&rsquo;s Beatrice and Benedict (Much Ado About Nothing) and Jane Austen&rsquo;s Darcy and Elizabeth (Pride and Prejudice). Each has the strength, self-respect, and facility for assertion that allows them to negotiate a mutually satisfactory relationship. Healthy intimacy demands the daily, hourly assertion of who you are and what you want and a willingness to look at how conflicting desires can come together to create a mutually enriching life.</p>

<p>Being good at your work is only one step toward job satisfaction. The next is to create a sense of human community where employees, customers, and other stakeholders feel seen and appreciated.</p>

<p><b>Warrior Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Breathe deep into your belly and ask yourself what you really desire. This is deeper and more primal than what you&#160;&ldquo;want,&rdquo; but it does not have to be just basic urges either. To what degree is your present life fulfilling these desires?<br />
<p><i>Step Two:</i> What are your values? What principles do you feel committed to standing up for? To what degree are you currently living up to your ethical standards?</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> Define your goals for the next few years. Then identify what you need to do&mdash;and by when&mdash;to accomplish them. Create a system of accountability so you can keep track of your progress.</p>
<p><i>Step Four:</i> What is happening in your life that seems to you to be going wrong? What might you do about it? Design and implement a plan of action to remedy this&#160;wrong.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 5<br />
Showing Generosity: The Altruist</h3>

<p>Are you as interested in <em>the effect of your work on the world</em> as you are in how much money or status it brings you?</p>

<p>We are living in a time of immense challenge and opportunity. The choices we&#160;make today as individuals collectively create the world we all will inhabit tomorrow. Progress is not automatic. Rather, it results from the aggregate decisions of individuals who consider not only their own good, but the greater good of society, humankind, and the planet.</p>

<p>&#8230;Buddhist practice teaches us to find happiness by letting go of our desires. Paradoxically, we can find satisfaction not through getting what we want, but by sacrificing ego attachment for the greater good of transcendent bliss.</p>

<p>The final lesson of the Altruist is to choose to give the gift of one&rsquo;s life for the giving&rsquo;s sake, knowing that life is its own reward and remembering that all the little deaths, the losses in our lives always bring with them transformation and new life, that actual deaths are not final but merely a more dramatic passage into the unknown.</p>

<p>Anyone involved in a serious, committed love relationship knows&#160;that you just have to let go of the need to always get your own way for that relationship to work. Most couples go through a Warrior period, in which both parties, in a battle of wills, try to remake the other in their own image. When this Pygmalion project fails, as it almost always does, it becomes possible to stop being two warring individuals and to establish a sense of &ldquo;us&rdquo; as a couple. When this happens, we make choices not necessarily because they are best for &ldquo;me,&rdquo; but because they are good for &ldquo;us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many people take jobs that do not pay well and offer little chance for promotion. They may work in day-care facilities, in homes for the aged, in community organizations, or in other places that make a great difference in the lives of those they serve. Few of us may know who they are, but they daily make the world a better place. Although the rewards may not translate into material wealth or power, if they know they truly are helping others, they rightly feel that their lives have meaning and value.</p>

<p class="important">Heroes do not wait to help the world until they have it all together. The hero brings life to a dying culture, in part, by being both caring and real. All of us can do this by living our lives fully. Our capacity to do so is related psychologically to our willingness to give what it requires of us: to love as fully as we can, even though we know that doing so opens us up to pain and sorrow; to live our vocational purpose, to do our work, even though we risk failure, poverty, or receiving little or no appreciation; and ultimately to die, for that is the price we pay for having lived.</p>

<p>I was talking recently with a friend about this book, and he said that to him the hero is someone who has endured life&rsquo;s trials and tribulations. When pressed, he explained that he actually meant something more than that. Heroes, he continued, not only endure hardships, they maintain their love of life, their courage, and their capacity to care for others. No matter how much suffering they experience, they do not pass it on. They absorb it and declare: &ldquo;Suffering stops here!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>THE DIGNITY OF RECEIVING</h4>
Once we define ourselves as the giver in a particular situation or relationship, we may not notice how much we also receive. This is particularly true for parents. &#8230;<br />
How great it feels when a child throws open her arms to greet you, jumping up and down with happiness, shouting &ldquo;Mommy&rsquo;s home!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s home!&rdquo;<br />
Raising Shanna, I have reconnected with the girl in me, learned to play again, and experienced daily delight and love. When I fully let that in, I know that she has brought at least as much to me as I have shared with her. Very few of our relationships really have to be one way. Therapists learn from their clients; teachers learn from their students; ministers learn from their congregations. When the energy is not flowing both ways, something is wrong. If the giving and receiving happen with no blocking, then both receive more than they give&mdash;because the process intensifies and enriches the energy exchanged.&#160; Learning to give or to sacrifice appropriately surely is as hard as learning to play baseball. Our first attempts always are very clumsy. People may misinterpret our giving and think we want something in return. Or, like the mother who abandons her career or the father who works in a field he hates in order to support his family, we overdo it. But with practice comes improvement; our giving and receiving take on the effortlessness shown by real pros playing catch. It all seems easy&mdash;throwing and catching and letting go again.<br />
For some people, giving is painful because they feel they have to control or manipulate everything if the ball is ever to come back to them. And if they think that&mdash;after having thrown the ball to first base, they have to get it back from first base&mdash;they may be sorely disappointed. But sooner or later&mdash;from third base or left field&mdash;the ball returns.<br />
The more we give in this kind of free way, the more we get, because nature abhors a vacuum; it fills us up.&#160;</p>

<p>Eating is a powerful symbol for taking a gift in, for nothing is truly a gift until it is received. Conscious receiving raises the difficult issue of choice and of taking responsibility for having chosen to let in one thing and not another. Yes, I will marry you, but not you. Yes, I will work with you, but not you.</p>

<p>Almost everyone gives what they would like to receive, without realizing that the other person may want something very different. I once was in a relationship with a man who felt I did not really love him because I did not do little things for him like sew buttons on his shirt. When he told me this, I got angry because I thought he was being a male chauvinist. Later, I realized that it was not so much that he wanted me to be conventionally female, but that his idea of how you show love was doing little things like that for one another. Because my idea of how to show love is to say, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and share the secrets of your heart, I felt unloved by him&mdash;not recognizing that he showed his love for me by returning my overdue library books! To stay together, we would have had to learn each other&rsquo;s giving vocabulary. </p>

<p>To commit is to risk the unknown, but even more than that it requires sacrificing the idea of the perfect mate to love a real, flawed human being.&#160;<br />
So, too, with life. Commitment to living this life means giving up rigid ideas about what the world should be and loving what it is. That, of course, does not mean that we do not work to make the world a better place or to improve our relationships. It means that we can give up the pose of being disappointed idealists and let ourselves know what a blessing it is to be alive. We allow ourselves to let it all in. It also means giving up the notion of scarcity&mdash;that there is not enough to go around and that I am not enough, you are not enough, and the world is not enough. In accepting life, we can believe that plenty of love, goods, and room are available to make us happy.</p>

<p>It can also help us spend less time on achievement and more time caring for others, less effort on keeping up with the Joneses and more on visiting with them to create real community or working with them to solve social problems.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we know more about who we are by the choices we make. For example, a parent who decides to pull back from career advancement to attend to a troubled teenager may feel some envy years later when colleagues have surpassed him in achievement.&#160;Yet, if he remembers that he made that decision himself and takes a moment to celebrate the benefit to the child, he can end up feeling ennobled, rather than cheated by life.</p>

<p>We all can have enough if we do not hoard. Our job is to appreciate thoroughly and treasure whatever we truly want that we already have and at the same time give up anything we no longer need.&#160;Our capacity to give away speaks to the universe of our willingness to receive. We do not have to hold on to things, protecting ourselves against a rainy day. If we freely give away, we also will receive freely&#160;just what we need.</p>

<p>When all have what they need to develop their full potential, the combined resources of the society are astoundingly high.</p>

<h4>GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE ALTRUIST ARCHETYPE</h4>
<p>To familiarize yourself with the Altruist archetype, make a collage out of Altruist-like pictures from magazines; make lists of songs, movies, and books that express the Altruist; collect pictures of yourself, relatives, colleagues, and friends in an Altruist mode. Practice noticing when you are thinking or acting like an Altruist.</p>

<p><b>Altruist Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Look for opportunities to be kind and caring to others. Every day, try to help someone. Make it a point continually to open your heart to give not only to those you love, but also to strangers. In every situation, think what the most loving thing you can do in this encounter is. Be particularly attuned to people who depend on you: a spouse or partner, parents, children, friends, and employees. Be attentive to what they need from you.</p>
<p><i>Step Two:</i> Pay attention to all the people, activities, and places you love. Notice especially when love simply lights you up or gives you energy. Take time to be grateful for these experiences. Notice how just paying attention increases the satisfaction you&#160;receive from them (as you stop simply taking them for granted). Begin increasing the time you choose to spend doing things and being with people you value.</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> Think of yourself as a philanthropist. Pay attention to how you can contribute your time, money, and expertise to benefit the larger society. Pay attention to what issues, causes, and organizations tug at your heartstrings. Decide what percentage of your time and money you are ready to give away. Consider how your own talents and abilities can be used to benefit society. Act on this to the best of your ability.</p>
<p><i>Step Four:</i> Remember with all these efforts to begin by loving and nurturing yourself. Notice how giving to others, in a way that comes from your genuine altruism, enhances your self-esteem and quality of life. Discontinue any ways that currently are giving you no satisfaction. Replace them with more authentic modes of giving.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 6<br />
Achieving Happiness: The Innocent&rsquo;s Return</h3>

<p>The hero finds the treasure.<br />
Are you ever filled with yearning for a better life? Do you believe life does not have to be hard? If these feelings are strong in you, or if you have many moments of true peace and contentment, you are ready for the return to innocence.</p>

<p>&#8230;we can and do return to safety, love, and abundance, but only as a result of taking our journeys.</p>

<p>Only when we begin to see ourselves as spiritual beings can we trust in the universe enough to take responsibility for healing ourselves and the planet.</p>

<p>You may have had such an awakening in one of the following ways:<br />
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>a religious conversion</li>
<li>a mystical experience</li>
<li>a sense of &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; in which the meaning of the universe or your own life is revealed</li>
<li>a sudden welling up of joy or peace</li>
<li>a feeling that the divine is within you or another person</li>
<li>a sense of awe at the wonder of nature, the universe, or life itself</li>
<li>a feeling of being absolutely where you ought to be</li>
</ul>
These are examples of the treasure the hero seeks.</p>

<p>Generally, we are not defeated in some dramatic and noticeable way. Rather, we are defeated by any number of small acts of self-betrayal masquerading as virtue that add up, over time, to an inauthentic life.</p>

<p>God says, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; and there is light. God names reality, and then it exists. If we think of ourselves as co-creators of our lives, we can interpret this story as a reminder of the need we all have to find our true voices. When we have a vision of what we want and verbalize that vision, we begin the process of manifesting a life just perfect for us.</p>

<p>Most of us long to find a place where we will feel, finally, at home. We seek and seek and seek, until one day we realize that the secret is within us. On the journey, we learn that we have choices about what worlds we wish to inhabit. When we take our journeys we begin to know who we are, what we value, and how we feel. Then, as we express our truth in the world, we attract to us others, like ourselves, who want to live in the same kind of happier way. Together, we form mini-kingdoms, communities of likeminded people who experiment with new ways of living. This&#160;process seems miraculous&mdash;like the transformed kingdom at the end of the hero&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>As we change, however, reality changes, too. The reward for taking the journey is finding communities that do not require us to lop off parts of ourselves to belong.</p>

<p>You may remember examples of the classic plot in which the hero is an orphan or is oppressed and unappreciated in the family and searches for his or her true home. As we become more and more who we are, and hence link up with others with whom we feel a deep connection, we have more, and more satisfying, relationships. The reward for the hero&rsquo;s inevitably solitary journey, then, is community&mdash;community with the self, with other people, and with nature and spirit. At the end of the journey, the hero feels and&#160;is at home.</p>

<p>As Gerald Jampolsky explains in&#160;Love Is Letting Go of Fear, all these layers of&#160;fear keep us from experiencing the love underneath.</p>

<p>In a slightly different version of the heroic myth, the hero becomes the king or queen. Updated to contemporary terms, it means that the hero often gravitates to leadership roles. ... As we take our journeys, it becomes natural to assume more responsibility&mdash;not only for our inner reality, but for the way our outer worlds mirror that reality.</p>

<p>We can affirm the life we want to have and declare that the demands on us that are inconsistent with our journeys have no power over us. Our lives also will lighten the minute we think, as Santiago does, of our experiences in terms of&#160;adventures&#160;rather than obligations and as&#160;a source of potential learning&#160;rather than frustrating distractions from the life we believe we deserve.</p>

<p>Rainmakers do not do anything to make the rain happen; they just go to the village and stay there&mdash;and the rain comes. They do not make the rain come, they allow it, or, more exactly, their inner atmosphere of allowing and affirming what&#160;is&#160;creates a climate in which what&#160;needs to be&#160;happens. Perhaps you have known people like that. It is not that they make the sun shine, the rain fall, or people in their office work harder, but when they are there, things work right&mdash;and, apparently, effortlessly.</p>

<p>But to the Innocent, blame is irrelevant, and the search for a culprit is a useless diversion. &ldquo;Who is to blame?&rdquo; is not a useful question. Better ones are &ldquo;What can I learn from this experience?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Given the wisdom I have gained from it, what do I want to choose now?&rdquo; [i.e. I can choose something else, a different experience now]<br />
From the vantage point of the Innocent, a woman may make meaning of the horrible experience of being abused by thinking that she had long had a batterer in her own head, telling her she was&#160;too fat, too selfish, too pushy. By getting into a situation in which she is physically or emotionally battered by someone else, she finally comes to the point where she says, &ldquo;Enough. I may be bad, but I am not bad enough to deserve this kind of treatment.&rdquo; So she finds help, gets out of the relationship, and works on her self-esteem to the point where she does not spend so much of her time at the mercy of her internal batterer. Although the external situation is painful, it produces a crisis that forces on her the opportunity to opt for growth, change, and eventually less pain in her life. Thus, attracting a battering relationship in the long run can be seen as bringing her health. In such ways, wise Innocents regard even their most difficult experiences as examples of Eden unfolding.</p>

<p>&#8230;a pattern of meaningful coincidence in the universe.<br />
Synchronicity is a term coined by C. G. Jung to describe such causal connections. While the Warrior learns the lessons of causality, the Innocent trusts synchronicity. You know those times when you go to a bookstore and just the book you needed (but had never heard of) practically falls into your hand? Or when you run into just the person you need, seemingly by accident? Those are examples of synchronicity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mirroring&mdash;when the world outside mirrors our world inside&mdash;is another aspect of the same phenomenon. Partly, as illustrated by the battered woman, the external world tends to dramatize what is going on internally so that we notice it. Mirroring also works another way. That is, often when we change our inner world, the outer one changes as well. For example, I know men and women who despair about ever finding true love. But once they take their own journey and develop their own capacity for love, they frequently are astounded by how many fascinating and thoroughly admirable people suddenly show an interest in them. <br />
When we are in the Wanderer [Orphan?] stage, the world is full of suffering. When we move into the Warrior stage, then the world miraculously changes with us and confronts us not so much with catastrophes as with challenges. In the Altruist stage, we find ourselves surrounded by people needing love and care at every turn. As we enter the Magician stage, we encounter situations and people needing to be transformed. The Innocent will see this as mirroring.</p>

<p>&#8230;noticing a prior pattern in your life of abusive relationships can help you see that this relationship may be your chance to free yourself. The issue initially may be that you need to call up your Wanderer to leave or your Warrior to stand up for yourself.&#160;</p>

<p>In&#160;Whee!, We, Wee All the Way Home&#160;(a title that suggests its Innocent perspective), theologian Matthew Fox argues that the ultimate prayer is to receive life fully:<br />
 A friend who gives me a record is pleased when he learns of my delight at playing the record. After all, my delight was the very goal he intended in giving me the gift. The Creator can be no different. Our thank-you for creation, our fundamental prayer, therefore, is our enjoyment and delight in it. This delight is called ecstasy when it reaches a certain height, and it is also prayer. Like all prayer, it touches the Creator and we are touched by the Creator in that act of ecstasy and thank-you.</p>

<p>A particularly touching part of the Passover seder is the recitation of a long list of things God did for the Hebrew people during the Exodus (for example, bringing them out of Egypt, providing manna in the desert, etc.). As each instance of divine help is recalled, the participants exclaim &ldquo;<br />
Dayenu!&rdquo;&mdash;literally, &ldquo;It would have been sufficient.&rdquo; It would have been sufficient even if God had not performed the next miracle. Yet, God performed them all.&#160;</p>

<p>A novel that illustrates the process of the return is Margaret Drabble&rsquo;s&#160;The Realms of Gold. Its central character, Frances Wingate, thinks back over her life with a humble sense of wonder at all she has received. Frances has a rather unusual capacity to trust herself and her vision, the result being that she habitually has asked for what she wanted&mdash;and gotten it. She is aware that she never has made things happen; they just have. She is an archaeologist who became quite famous when she discovered the ruins of an ancient city in a desert. Actually, one day in an airport she realized that she simply knew where it was. Of course, this knowledge was grounded in all her study of the ancient culture of the&#160;Phoenicians, but it was the intuitive flash that made the difference. Furthermore, she unquestioningly followed her hunch and then found and excavated the site. She wonders:<br />
 If I hadn&rsquo;t imagined it, it wouldn&rsquo;t have existed. All her life, things had been like that. She had imagined herself doing well at school, and had done well. Marrying, and had married. Bearing children, and had borne them. Being rich, and had become rich. Being free, and was free. Finding true love, and had found it. Losing it, and had lost it. What next should she imagine?<br />
The enormity of this power frightens her. She worries that she might imagine something frightful, and that would happen too. Accordingly, she comes face to face with her sense of responsibility for her own life and her contributions to the world.</p>

<p>She visualizes what she wants and takes action to get it with a simple, relaxed confidence that it will happen, without falling into denial or escapism.</p>

<p>Such wisdom is influencing management theory and practice today. Consultant David L. Cooperrider helps organizations put aside their problems long enough to find out their strengths and their values. He calls this approach &ldquo;appreciative inquiry,&rdquo; noting that organizational systems have their own logic, just as do individual souls. He explains that &ldquo;any system or society flourishes only so long as it has a positive image of itself&mdash;its past, present, and future.&rdquo; Cooperrider&rsquo;s approach helps us find the soul of the organization, its deepest values and commitments. Any desire to change an organization that does not honor its core truth and that does not trust in its own worth and that of the people in it eventually will do more harm than good.</p>

<p>In our personal lives, the Innocent archetype can help us achieve happiness even when we do not yet have what we want. It provides us with the faith that we always will have what we&#160;<br />
need&#160;to grow. &#8230; each gift has its own time.</p>

<p>The Innocent tells us that we can reenter paradise whenever we are ready to do so. We do it not by controlling what happens to us, but by learning to recognize possibilities we have not previously seen. The Warrior believes we have to force people to move into the new world; the Altruist believes that social change requires sacrifice; the Magician explores the limits of our abilities to redeem the world. The Innocent, however, knows that we need&#160;only to be presented with an option. People are attracted to increased life. Left to themselves, they will gravitate to it.<br />
Mary Staton&rsquo;s science-fiction classic&#160;From the Legend of Biel&#160;describes a civilization that slowly grows to encompass most of the universe, yet never fights a battle. The civilization is peaceful, egalitarian, and complex. Other groups join it not because they are forced to, but because their curiosity always eventually leads them to it. When they get there, they find themselves in the Hall of a Thousand Chambers, where they experience many adventures. In the process, they evolve and discover who they are on a deeper level, moving from dualistic, hierarchical, patriarchal consciousness to a more complex, multidimensional, and egalitarian perspective. Once they have advanced to that level, they cannot imagine going back to their former ways of doing things. That would be like crawling after they had learned to walk&mdash;or fly.</p>

<p>Innocents act as magnets who attract and galvanize positive energy for change. They do this by identifying the places where growth can occur for individuals, institutions, or social groups, and then by fostering it. Although they may or may not be the leaders in a particular political, religious, or intellectual movement, they act as rainmakers. When they are there, growth occurs.</p>

<h4>GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE INNOCENT ARCHETYPE</h4>
<p>To familiarize yourself with the Innocent archetype, make a collage out of Innocent-like pictures from magazines; make lists of songs, movies, and books that express the Innocent; collect pictures of yourself, relatives, colleagues, and friends in an Innocent mode. Practice noticing when you are thinking or acting like an Innocent.</p>
<p><b>Innocent Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Every day, spend as much time as you can appreciating what you have. Thank people who are helpful to you.</p>
<p><i>Step Two:</i> When you have a problem, affirm the outcome you want as if it were present in your life already. Hold the vision of your ideal outcome. Write a sentence that describes what you want, but phrase it in the&#160;present tense. When thoughts of fear or luck begin to make you anxious, deny their power over you and return your focus to more hopeful words or images.</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> Trust your inner guidance. Practice prayer and/or meditation to listen for guidance. Remain open to hear this inner voice as you go through your day.</p>
<p><i>Step Four:</i> Keep a record of your dreams, treating them as letters sent from your unconscious mind to make you aware of what your conscious mind may be missing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 7<br />
Transforming Your Life: The Magician</h3>

<p>&#8230;the Magician in all of us knows that any lack of balance in our external world reflects imbalance inside. To do magic we must focus our energies so that they are not dissipated.</p>

<p>When our lives feel unmanageable, one or more archetypes is dominating the others. For example, we are out of balance in:<br />
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>the Innocent, if we try to be perfect and please everyone;</li>
<li>the Orphan, if we are distracted from the tasks at hand by our fears and anxieties (so that we worry rather than make progress);</li>
<li>the Wanderer, if we spend endless hours on self-improvement projects in the hope of someday being &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; to get everything done;</li>
<li>the Warrior, if we are driven to achieve, and just cannot stop striving to be the best;</li>
<li>the Altruist, if we spend time doing for others what they could and ought to do for themselves;</li>
<li>the Magician, if we are so inflated that we think we can do anything and everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of us do not even realize that we&#160;can&#160;make choices to have the kinds of lives we want. We do not have to take the advice of (or&#160;please or impress) the experts, relatives, and friends, however well-meaning they might be. Many people today are like a motorist who sits in the passenger seat of his car because a whole group of people are hogging the driver&rsquo;s seat, fighting for control of the wheel.</p>

<p>Similarly, when the Magician archetype is activated, you feel confident that you know what ought to be done to transform your life or your world. You stop letting others make your decisions, and you develop a vision for where you want to go. You also are willing to risk action&mdash;to get behind the wheel of your life. You activate the gear shift of magic when you begin to act in keeping with your values and your life purpose. It is as if you place yourself in just that magical position that allows the gears of the universe to align with you and support your efforts.&#160;When you do so, you find that fortuitous coincidences begin to occur that open a path for you.</p>

<p class="important">The universe is not a static thing. It is in the process of being created all the time&mdash;by all of us.</p>

<p>We step into the point of power inside our own magic circles when we act on the knowledge that we have as much right as does anyone else to determine the world&rsquo;s future. There are many possible outcomes for humankind. Nothing is locked in. We cast our vote for the world we prefer for ourselves and our children with every choice we make every day.</p>

<p>When you find work that uses all your prior experience, it feels incredibly magical, like you are a puzzle piece dropping into place. ... Moreover, as you do the work that you most love, you&#160;<br />
undoubtedly will do it very well. As you become more successful, you increase your contribution to a flourishing economy.</p>

<p>&#8230;in most spiritual traditions, magical abilities are a result of disciplined study and practices designed to help individuals align their wills with the divine. In the alchemical tradition, the ideal of changing lead to gold (by a kind of telekinesis, or mind over matter) was not so much about chemistry as it was a sign that the consciousness of the alchemist had become golden as a result of long and disciplined practice.<br />
From this perspective we can think of our difficult experiences as providing cauldrons that help refine our consciousness.</p>

<p>The Magician shares a basic worldview with the Innocent, but claims a greater amount of power. Innocents go with the flow and trust God, the universe, and/or the process of history. Magicians take responsibility in a more active and immediate way for the state of their lives or of the planet. This means that they often add a revolutionary consciousness to the hero&rsquo;s journey. They say: &ldquo;When things are not all right, I will stand and be counted.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>SETTING THE WORLD RIGHT</h4>
When the Magician archetype is active in your life, you may sense an inner call to make a difference in the world&mdash;in ways that might seem risky. You might even feel inadequate to the task.</p>

<p>If you are feeling angry about a family, school, organizational, or societal problem of any kind&mdash;especially if you feel passionate about that particular issue&mdash;this is&#160;your&#160;call to action.&#160;</p>

<p>Magicians are able to effect seemingly magical change precisely because they do not give away their power.</p>

<p>The point is that anyone who takes a stand for justice anywhere, on behalf of anyone, contributes to our liberation from the insidious idea that some people are intrinsically better than others.</p>

<p>The Magician archetype demands that we move out of alienation and take the wheel of our own destinies. This, in turn, requires us to think of ourselves as being at the center of life, determining the future. Therefore, to be a Magician, it is essential to know what you stand for. You can begin with what bothers you about the world. Listen to what you complain about and you will know what you are called upon to use your magic to rectify.</p>

<p>Prospero&rsquo;s situation illustrates two principles. First, we violate the order of the universe when we fail to be true to our purpose for being here. Second, we create disorder when we allow others to harm us.</p>

<p>It is important to recognize, as does Prospero, that we disturb the order of the universe not only when we harm someone else, but also if we allow anyone to take advantage of us.&#160;I frequently see managers who are willing to overlook nonproductive and noncollegial behavior in employees&mdash;especially if these supervisors are afraid of being charged with racism, sexism, or general unfairness, or if they fear challenging someone with connections to powerful people. These ineffective employees, then, never learn how to be productive and successful in the workplace.<br />
&#8230;twelve-step programs have participants regularly&#160;conduct a moral inventory and make amends to anyone they have harmed. If doing this can help keep alcoholics and drug addicts sober, imagine what it can do for people who are not, or not yet, addicted to anything. The point is, people are designed to be moral. If we do not do what&rsquo;s right by our own lights, we not only mess up our own lives, we mess up the world. Certainly, we are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol&mdash;not to mention falling prey to workaholism or codependence&mdash;if we have reason to want to be distracted from facing the truth about ourselves.</p>

<p>Indeed, successful people are not necessarily any more able than others; they just are more willing to see their mistakes as opportunities to grow.</p>

<h4>INTEGRATING THE SHADOW</h4>
When the Magician archetype emerges, the shadow aspect is never far away. This can be a dangerous time, because we can be possessed by its negativity and live it out. The shadow-possessed Magician can be truly evil, using the power of charisma to seduce, manipulate, and destroy, rather than to elevate. &#160;</p>

<p>&#8230;on the journey, we have to face the fact that we have evil within ourselves.</p>

<p>The truth is, any time we take a risk to act, we will be challenged to integrate some shadow element of ourselves. This is an ongoing process. What differentiates magical people from others is their capacity for honest self-reflection. They neither shrink from seeing negative truths about themselves or their group nor banish aspects of themselves that seem troubling. Rather, they seek to find the gold in the shadow.</p>

<p>The alcoholic I just discussed became one because initially he was unable to integrate his pain or his vices into his self-concept. It took a twelve-step program, many years later, to help him learn how. When we can accept our sadness, our loneliness, our anger, our self-destructiveness, and our childlike&#160;wish to be cared for, we do not have to anesthetize ourselves. Moreover, we can open up to respect our childlike vulnerability, our independence, our appropriate moral outrage, our willingness to give, and our faith&mdash;that is, the positive poles of the negative traits just listed. This is why taking the Orphan&rsquo;s, Warrior&rsquo;s, Wanderer&rsquo;s, Altruist&rsquo;s, and Innocent&rsquo;s journeys prevents addiction.</p>

<p>We also can create a shadow identity by repressing desire. For instance, our culture is just moving out of Puritanism to deal with the shadow of sexuality, which often manifests itself in perverse yet extremely powerful forms. Sex is used in advertising to sell everything from cars to power tools, either by subliminal means or by having scantily clad women (or men) standing by the object being sold. Such juxtaposition makes no logical sense unless we understand that we quite simply are possessed by our repressed sexuality. In contemporary movies and in contemporary life, sexuality often is accompanied by violence. Rape, violent seduction, child molestation, pornography, and sadomasochism all speak to the reality of our culture&rsquo;s shadow possession, as do the more subtle but even more pervasive sexual relationships in which one or both of the parties is objectified. Integrating the shadow, in this case, can lead to ecstatic experiences of healthy and spiritual eroticism.</p>

<p>The Innocent teaches us to love the world just the way it is. If our Magician is balanced by a strong Innocent, we can take steps to make our dreams come true without feeling overly attached to doing so. However, if we become compulsive about getting our way, we subtly undermine any magic in our lives. Instead of linking easily and effortlessly with those who genuinely share our goals, we run the risk of getting bogged down in Pygmalion projects, trying desperately to change others (or the world) so that we can have what we desire. &#8230; At this point, the Magician can become an evil sorcerer.</p>

<p>People with a Warrior mind-set assume that the appropriate response when we see the shadow within or without is to slay the dragon&mdash;to get rid of the sexuality or the obsessiveness. What happens then, however, is more repression, and the dragon gets bigger, and the possession gets more pronounced. When the Warrior/Altruist resolution is achieved, we learn to face the dragon and to recognize that it is dangerous&mdash;to ourselves and to others&mdash;but then to transform the monster by affirming it and acknowledging it as our own.<br />
Violence is caused in large part by the repression of assertiveness. We learn to be nice, to give in, that we do not have the right to ask for what we want. Many of us are not taught skills for recognizing and asserting our needs. Consequently, emotions build up like an internal time bomb. The result is an explosion&mdash;anger, perhaps emotional or even physical violence inflicted on ourselves or another person. Paradoxically, the antidote to violence is not just self-control (which by itself can lead to repression), but self-knowledge and the skills of self-expression and assertion.<br />
Magicians understand the courage and audacity involved in asserting themselves and their will on the universe when they themselves are not yet whole. To do so means letting loose their demons upon the world. Actually, because we all are co-creators whether we want to be or not, we always run this risk anyway. However, Magicians take responsibility for this process and basically trust it. If dragons are but their shadows, their unnamed, unloved parts, then the only way to transform them is to act, and by acting bring them into the light of day.</p>

<p>Our task is to integrate the shadow by finding the positive energy behind the negative behavior.</p>

<p>The Magician&rsquo;s goal is not to slay but to&#160;name&#160;the dragon&mdash;to reinstate community through communication.</p>

<p>Madeleine L&rsquo;Engle&rsquo;s novel for adolescents,&#160;A Wind in the Door, illustrates the power of positive naming, even when dealing with&#160;evil&#8230; A Namer, it turns out, is someone who helps things and people know who they are. For example, Meg&rsquo;s friend Calvin is a Namer to her because she feels more like herself when she is with him than at any other time.</p>

<p>Meg implicitly understands the principle of the microcosm and the macrocosm that is basic to magic. If she is a microcosm of the universe, then anything &ldquo;out there&rdquo; is also &ldquo;in here.&rdquo; We all have some part of ourselves that we might call our &ldquo;self-hater&rdquo; that seeks either to tempt us with visions of grandeur or undercut our belief that what we do matters. Thus, we all have an Echthroi part seeking to divert us from our life purpose. As we learn to love the enemy without, we also learn to love (and in this way domesticate) the enemy within. The fearsome dragon we most fear, outside ourselves, holds the key to the shadow within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; suggests that we can transform not only ourselves but others by loving them just as they are&mdash;&ldquo;naming&rdquo; them as lovable, even with all their imperfections.</p>

<p>In our culture, love often means indulging people, allowing them to mistreat you. Such passivity involves a subtle kind of despair. Magicians challenge people precisely because they trust that there is more to them than their current self-indulgent or self-destructive behavior. I have seen more men changed, I think, when their wives stopped putting up with their chauvinism than when they just accepted it. I have seen women change when their husbands stopped sacrificing their own journeys to make enough money to support them in the style to which they had become accustomed. I also have seen children change when their parents have stopped spoiling them and have set appropriate limits on their behavior and spending.</p>

<h4>BEING REAL, BEING VULNERABLE</h4>
Being ladylike or gentlemanly and denying one&rsquo;s anger simply results in the unconscious sabotage of relationships. Expressing one&rsquo;s anger is transformative because it allows for a true and open, honest relationship. It makes way, therefore, for love.&#160;</p>

<p>It takes so much courage and discipline to live with true integrity moment to moment that we cannot do it without having gone through the stage of being a Warrior. To be honest and open in the moment is to be profoundly vulnerable. It does not allow for manipulation and control, but it does allow for intimacy, for love, and, occasionally, for magic moments.</p>

<p>The most effective leaders I encounter in my executive coaching practice &#8230; I have observed patterns in what they do. They believe in people, notice them as individuals, and show that they care. They also have no difficulty setting boundaries when someone is not performing. People know they will&#160;have all the support they need if they are doing their best. However, if employees are not performing competently in their current jobs, the manager talks to them about whether this job is right for them. If so, training options are considered to help them become more successful. If not, they might be moved to another position or let go (with active encouragement to find fulfillment elsewhere). But most of all, such managers save a lot of time that others spend worrying, because they expect to succeed&mdash;and typically do.</p>

<p>Warriors also act immediately when change is needed. The difference is that Warriors strategize to make change happen, while Magicians envision the desired outcome and get moving, trusting synchronicity to help them work out the details.<br />
When things become difficult, the Magician may accept that magic currently is not working in the outside world. Often what is happening instead is that the magic is working inside. We are being initiated to a higher level of consciousness by the difficulties we are experiencing. As our consciousness is transformed, the outer world changes accordingly, though sometimes this process takes time and ingenuity.</p>

<p>If what you want (and what fits with your journey) does not exist yet or is in very short supply, you may need to invent it or just wait. Magicians know that timing is critical. Sometimes the partner you want is there, but not yet at the right place in his or her journey to meet you. Perhaps the culture you live in does not have a standard form of employment to match your vocation. For example, one woman I know felt very aimless and went to a psychic, who told her that her problem was being by nature a temple-keeper in a world with no temples. There are no ads in the paper&#160;for temple-keepers. She became a massage therapist and healer practicing out of her home, which she redesigned to be a sanctuary in the midst of a chaotic, high-pressure city. This is where it is helpful to remember synchronicity. Rarely are persons so far ahead of their culture that they are not, at least in some ways, a microcosm of it. Temple-keepers may not find literal temples, but they can maintain figurative ones when they find out what they revere as sacred; then they can keep those things safe.<br />
[I can also be an astronaut and a rock-star although there's no employment for that in my environment.]</p>

<p>&#8230;it is important to understand how profoundly our lives can be changed even in our present society. I have noticed people in the same country who seem to be living in different realities. There are those whose lives are defined by scarcity, loneliness, fear, poverty (of goods or of spirit, which makes even the wealthy feel poor), and ugliness; and there are those who are surrounded by love, beauty, and abundance and who feel befriended, prosperous, and happy. Similarly, some people are living mentally and emotionally in the nineteenth century, while others are living in the twenty-first. In many ways, we truly inhabit different worlds.<br />
When the Magician is active in our lives, we choose the world we live in.</p>

<p>There are many ways to inhabit other worlds, only one of which is in the physical body. Every one of us has the capacity to journey in our imagination and, in doing so, to change our consciousness.</p>

<p>The legacy of the Magician is that if we are willing to experience whatever initiation it takes to become magical ourselves, there are no odds too great to stop us.</p>

<h4>CREATING CAMELOT</h4>

<p>Creating our own utopian worlds is an ongoing, daily process.</p>

<p>&#8230;the shaman&rsquo;s practice of leaving the everyday world to move into the imaginal realm. All of us can do this when we shift from focusing on problems to imagining the world we would like to inhabit.<br />
Often, we dismiss our moments of vision simply as escapist daydreams. Merlin, however, takes his seriously, calling the vision Camelot. For the rest of his life, he holds up all choices against this vision, deciding to act consistently in ways that lead to its realization. You and I can do this by taking visioning seriously in our work and our private lives, living every day as if we were bringing into being our own personal Camelot.</p>

<p>The lesson for us today is that no one creates paradise alone. It is essential to link up with others who have similar dreams and values and to organize both a collective effort (with an emphasis on accomplishing goals) and a genuine, caring community (with a primary focus on the nurturance and development of individuals).<br />
The key players of Camelot also find or create sacred objects that facilitate the work: Arthur&rsquo;s magic sword, which comes from the Lady of the Lake, a Celtic goddess of great power; the Round Table, which is part of Guenevere&rsquo;s dowry when she is betrothed to Arthur; and the castle of Camelot, which Arthur and Merlin design and have built. Similarly, each of us needs to find or produce the forms that perfectly match their function. In the modern world, this might include the right office or home environment, the appropriate technological support, and any and all physical structures that grease the wheels of success.</p>

<p>&#8230;no matter how powerful our collective visions may be, they hold our allegiance only to the extent that they coincide with our sense of individual purpose.</p>

<p>If you are in the process of creating your own personal Camelot and things do not go smoothly, you can do a rough check to see what might be out of balance. Have you committed to a clear vision? Do the other stakeholders share that vision with you? Have you matched talents to task to get things done? Do all of you share a genuine sense of community? Are the physical structures and technology appropriate to realizing your vision? Is that vision congruent with the values of all concerned?</p>

<p>First, visualize what it would be like to have a life that is in balance. Second, make a clear decision to commit to balance &ldquo;no matter what.&rdquo; Third, share your positive intent with those around you, asking for their input and support to manifest this sane and enjoyable life. Fourth, take action to reflect this commitment in the actual structures of your life. (For example, you might negotiate to work part-time, stop rescuing others when they fail to meet their obligations, or hire or collaborate with others to pick up some of what you have been doing.) Fifth, tune in to your deeper values, allowing back into your life those activities that reflect them. (For instance, you might want to spend more time with your children or friends, take walks in nature, meditate, or express your creativity through music or art.)</p>

<p>&#8230;the results of scientific experiments seem related to the expectations of the researcher&mdash;which means that even at the level of physics, our minds influence the world (or, at least, our expectations predetermine, to some degree, the results of our laboratory experiments).<br />
(Margaret Wheatley,&#160;Leadership and the New Science: Learning About Organization from an Orderly Universe&#160;(San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., 1992), pp. 56&ndash;57.)</p>

<p>The secret is to withdraw your resistance to being transformed. Shevek, the central character in Ursula Le Guin&rsquo;s novel&#160;The Dispossessed, sums up the Magician&rsquo;s wisdom when he says, &ldquo;You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE MAGICIAN ARCHETYPE</h4>
To familiarize yourself with the Magician archetype, make a collage out of Magician-like pictures from magazines; make lists of songs, movies, and books that express the Magician; collect pictures of yourself, relatives, colleagues, and friends in a Magician mode. Practice noticing when you are thinking or acting like a Magician.</p>
<p><b>Magician Exercises</b></p>
<p><i>Step One:</i> Describe what it would be like to have an ideal balance in your own life; then live in a way that is congruent with your vision.</p>
<p><i>Step Two:</i> Visualize the world as you want it to be; then cast your vote for this outcome by how you live your life every day.</p>
<p><i>Step Three:</i> Identify people and groups that you judge negatively or dislike, as a way to identify your own shadow. Explore how you might see the shadow in yourself&mdash;either in your own&#160;behavior or what you feel but fear to express. Think of responsible ways to affirm the more positive aspects of this shadow and integrate them into your life.</p>
<p><i>Step Four:</i> Practice standing up for your principles without making anyone else wrong or bad. Make clear to others what you believe in and where your commitments are, but act lovingly as you do so.</p>
<p><i>Step Five:</i> Be honest with yourself about your own failings and atone for any misdeeds. Notice what part of you is responsible for the negative outcome. Then pay attention to the positive desire beneath the negative behavior and act to fill this underlying need.</p>
<p><i>Step Six:</i> Practice seeing the positive potential in people and situations, &ldquo;naming&rdquo; that potential in nonshaming, nonblaming ways (while also holding boundaries to be certain that you and others are not harmed by current negative behaviors).</p>

<h3>PART 2<br />
Personal Mastery: The Guidebook</h3>

<p>Personal mastery means that we are capable of becoming conscious of any discrepancies between our outer role commitments and our emerging inner archetypal realities. We stop trying to be all things to all people and focus instead on expressing our own inner truth and meeting the challenges that are meaningful to us.</p>

<p>The Orphan emerges when we fall from innocence, when something happens that undermines our faith&mdash;in our parents, authority figures, God, even life itself. As we face our disappointment at living in a fallen world, the Wanderer escapes from captivity and prompts us to head out on our own to discover what is possible. However, we soon learn that we cannot always leave when things do not go right. At this point, the Warrior helps uslearn to stay and assert ourselves. But in the normal progression of life, if we are always battling, we find ourselves isolated and alone. When the Altruist emerges, we discover the joys of giving to and caring for others. By this time, we no longer feel so vulnerable. The return to innocence heals the wounded inner child and allows us to trust life. Then the Magician appears, and we gain personal mastery and the ability to make life-affirming choices.<br />
This process creates an inner &ldquo;family&rdquo; that can compensate for any deficits in our family of origin. That is, when you gain a family within, your life no longer is limited by what you had or did not have as a child. You carry a healthy family with you always.</p>

<p>Having developed boundaries, it does not seem so frightening to open our hearts to receive. We know that if anything hurtful comes our way, we can defend ourselves.</p>

<p>It also is true that we always have access to every archetypal mode. What &ldquo;stage&rdquo; we are in has to do with where we &ldquo;hang out&rdquo; the most, where we spend the greatest percentage of our time. &#8230; Most of us have a favorite archetype throughout life, but we need access to all the others to traverse predictable life passages successfully. If we continue to grow in this way, we will gain wisdom as we age.<br />
The fact that people address certain developmental tasks in a predictable order&#160;does not mean that we leave one archetype behind in a linear fashion and go on to another. We attain deeper levels of understanding and higher levels of performance associated with any one of the archetypes only by intensifying our investment in the others.</p>

<p>Leading a full and complex life requires the following:<br />
&bull; The ability to anticipate problems so that you can avoid overload (Orphan);<br />
&bull; Some form of authentic self-expression (Wanderer); [creating art]<br />
&bull; Clear goals and the will to achieve them (Warrior);<br />
&bull; Generosity toward family, friends, and colleagues and concern for the good of the whole society (Altruist);<br />
&bull; A sense of faith and trust in a God, Goddess, Higher Power, or simply life itself (Innocent); and<br />
&bull; That you take responsibility for existential choice and creating or restoring the balance that is right for you at any given time (Magician).</p>

<p>If others see you very differently than you see yourself, however, you may want to work on aligning your everyday personality and behavior with your inner truth.</p>

<p>Internal Archetype Possible Outer Expression<br />
Orphan Participation in therapy or a recovery program, reaching out to others in need, involvement in liberation movements<br />
Wanderer travel, exploration of new ideas or experiences, starting a new endeavor<br />
Warrior Competitive endeavors, setting and achieving goals, asserting your needs and keeping strong boundaries, building physical strength<br />
Altruist Taking care of the elderly, volunteer and community services, philanthropic efforts<br />
Innocent Prayer and meditation, creative/artistic pursuits, celebrating, having fun<br />
Magician Being a catalyst for change, exerting influence or leadership, making big decisions, helping others work well together, creating new models, practices, or approaches (innovation)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 8<br />
Honoring Your Life: The Route</h3>

<p>&#8230;we reencounter situations that throw us back into prior stages so that we may learn and relearn the lessons at new levels of intellectual and emotional complexity and subtlety.</p>

<p>It is not so much that we go anywhere, but that we fill out. You know how some people feel shallow to us, as if there is not much there? Their souls seem thin, anorexic. The journey fills people out and gives them substance. Those who have taken their journeys feel bigger&mdash;even if their bodies are slender or they are small of stature. We feel the size of their souls.</p>

<p>In our first tries at warrioring, for example, we may come on like Attila the Hun, but later we may learn to assert our own wishes so appropriately and gently that we can negotiate for what we want without any noticeable conflict. We then have the Warrior to protect our boundaries as we focus our energy on accomplishment.</p>

<h4>FINDING WHOLENESS</h4>
Most of us are used to thinking that higher is better, so we want to move out of the &ldquo;lower&rdquo; archetypes to develop the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; ones. But the spiral pattern is not so much about advancing as it is about expanding. It might be helpful to think of the spiral growing wider and wider as we become capable of a larger range of responses to life and thus are able to have more of it. We take in more and have more choices. The circular diagram reminds us that we do not have to choose the &ldquo;best&rdquo; archetype. Rather, we can seek to balance our expression of all of them. </p>

<p> The point, however, is that the archetypes are interrelated, and often we cannot resolve the psychological or cognitive dilemma embedded in one without working through&#160;another. For example, if you are focused on achievement but are not willing to help others, you are likely to be distrusted by others and hence be less successful than you could be. Conversely, if you give to others but have no boundaries, you may be run over by others&rsquo; demands. The Warrior and Altruist are two complementary ways of making a difference in the world. When they are in balance, life is more satisfying and fulfilling&mdash;not only for individuals but for groups.</p>

<p>Any massive change, commitment, or crisis requires a reconsideration of identity issues. Each time we encounter the same archetype, we have the opportunity to do so at a deeper level of understanding.</p>

<p>But when those who are at an earlier stage of development jump prematurely into a role that requires an archetype or archetypal level that is beyond them, their growth can be stultified. For example, parents who are Altruists may teach their children the virtues of giving unselfishly to others without realizing that children&#160;and adolescents also must develop some assertiveness, spunk, and competence; otherwise their overly stimulated Altruist can cause them to be used by others, to martyr themselves, and to give their lives away.</p>

<p>At worst, Wanderers abdicate responsibility for the political process; but at best they serve as pioneers, seeking out new political experiments. In times of major cultural transformation such as now, Wanderers also may remove themselves from direct political action, yet address identity and value concerns to help make new politics possible.<br />
Magicians are more likely to emphasize the creation of new or alternative communities, institutions, and ways of relating to one another, or to work at the local or organizational level until grassroots efforts make major change at the national and international levels more likely. At worst, such changes are quirky, naive, or cultlike. At best, they provide the seeds that sprout into the creation of a new world.</p>

<p>There are times for recognizing when others know more or are better leaders, and you should follow them. There are times when it is best to remove yourself from the action to be sure of your values. There are times for political engagement. There are times to focus on what you can create right where you are.</p>

<p>For people just moving out of the martyr stage of the Altruist mode, any positive statement about the value of sacrifice is likely to seem masochistic, sick, or codependent. Of course, such sentiments generally are right, at least for the person expressing them. If we are just moving from Altruists into being Wanderers, the temptation to stop the journey and give to others is an ever present and real threat.</p>

<p>Few of us can just say to a partner or lover that we are ready to move on and leave with a simple thank-you for what has been. Instead, we spend a great deal of time chronicling the faults of our former lover and how bad the relationship was. Often, we create high drama to divert ourselves from our fear of the unknown or because we do not believe we have a right to leave anything unless it is absolutely awful.</p>

<p>&#8230;understand the&#160;power we have by simply disciplining our own thinking. Every thought essentially is a vote for the life we want to experience, because we strengthen what we focus on in both our inner and outer worlds.</p>

<p>Most of us are aware of the importance of socialization in childhood. Many of us forget, however, that we always are being socialized, at every stage of life. Every time you take a new job, adopt a new friendship network, engage in any kind of organized activity, or move to a different place, you are affected by your environment.<br />
The archetypes we allow to be expressed in our lives tend to evolve more than those we repress, hide, or deemphasize. Thus, every time we make a choice to place ourselves in a new environment, we affect our archetypal development. With this in mind, it is important when making life choices to recognize their implications for who we want to become.</p>

<p>If any school or workplace environment currently is problematic for you, remember that each archetype has its own plot. Moving into such an environment is like stepping onto a movie set&mdash;you simply have to relate to the plot being enacted there or you are irrelevant and in the way. Of course, you can try to change the plot being acted out, but doing so takes time and skill. Experiment by writing the story of your time on that set in a way that produces a happy ending.</p>

<p>You may fear that people will be thrown off if, say, you experiment with some of your assertive skills at home or your nurturance skills at work. Or you might fear a loss of power, as you put aside highly developed skills to try out what you may be awkward at and unsure about at first. Yet you might find it interesting, challenging, and even fun to vary your repertoire and experiment with new approaches to old situations. Being assertive in your private life, for instance, is different in style and in substance than assertiveness in public life. You learn new aspects of each archetype based on the context you are in.</p>

<p>&#8230;as you change and grow, a few acquaintances may drift away, but your compensation is that gradually you will attract to you people who appreciate what you are or are becoming.</p>

<p>There is a limit to how far any of us can develop without taking others with us&mdash;and sometimes, if we grow very quickly, we may choose to wait around for others who trail behind. In fact, sometimes we have to wait for environmental factors to catch up if we hope to have an impact.&#160;</p>

<p>In the Exodus story, the Hebrews leave a condition of slavery in Egypt and wander in the wilderness for forty years; metaphorically there are two important lessons here. First, the Hebrews remain in exile until the last of the those who were slaves die off. So, too, during our own journeys, slavish and childish attitudes in us must die before we can enter the promised land. &#8230; Second, those who are able to reach this goal have gone through experiences in the desert that have changed them all in similar ways. As individuals, we can have brief experiences of the consciousness of the promised land, but it is difficult to sustain it alone. For many, those moments of illumination feel like just a peek at what is ahead. To sustain the experience over time, we need the support of others who see and know this place too. The journey is not just about me and mine. It is about&#160;us. Thus, it is not necessarily a violation of your journey to wait around for people you care about, or who are&#160;dependent upon you, to catch up, instead of moving on without them. If you were climbing in the Himalayas, for instance, all the members of your party would help each other make it. We can take the same attitude on our developmental journeys, giving each other a leg up when we need it.</p>

<p>Exercise E: Make a list of the people close to you&mdash;your family, friends, co-workers, etc. How does each of them affect your journey? Who among them is important enough to make you either hold back or pick up your pace to stay together? Are there institutions that you also care that much about&mdash;a workplace, a school, a church or synagogue, a political party, a movement? If so, what captures your allegiance in that way.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 9<br />
Troubleshooting When You Get Lost or Stuck: The Compass</h3>

<blockquote class="important"><p><q>Life presents us with repeated opportunities to face what we fear, what we need to become conscious of, or what we need to master. Each time we cycle around the spiral path to the place that gives us difficulty, hopefully, we gain more consciousness and can respond more wisely the next time; until we can finally pass through that nemesis place at peace and in harmony with our deepest values, and not be negatively affected at all.</q></p>
<p class="author">Jean Shinoda Bolen, <cite>Goddesses in Everywoman</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>A woman once shared with me that before she read the earlier edition of this book she knew intuitively that she had the capacity to transform her life, but she did not know how to start. The book in general, and the Magician chapter in particular, she said, provided&#160;a toehold that allowed her to get her footing.</p>

<p>Generally, when we feel lost or stuck, our natural archetypal development has been interrupted in some way. Such blocks occur for two major reasons:<br />
&bull; we have become overidentified with one archetype to the detriment of others, or<br />
&bull; we have repressed an archetype, so that it is not available when we find ourselves in a new situation, or we become possessed by its shadow form.</p>

<p>A woman who nurtures and serves others may be praised as &ldquo;good,&rdquo; unlike other &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;angry&rdquo; women. The fear of seeming unfeminine or selfish can keep her in a box.</p>

<p>The only way to achieve balance in our outer lives is to attain greater archetypal balance in our inner worlds.</p>

<p>Our archetypal natures are affected strongly by every social system we spend our time in. If, for example, you take a job in an environment in which the Warrior predominates, you will need to have a strong Warrior to survive.</p>

<p>The psyche is incredibly wise. The reason some people &ldquo;forget&rdquo; or repress difficult childhood memories is that they are not yet strong enough to deal with them. Those who have activated their Warrior and Wanderer, for example, before they confront their childhood traumas have an easier time recovering than others for whom only the Innocent and Orphan archetypes are functioning. Moreover, they are more likely to be able to continue to have fulfilling lives at the same time as they recover from the abuse. However, in an Orphan culture, bonding occurs around wounding. When we share our suffering, we feel close to one another. Anyone who brings in a great success story, however, may find him- or herself subtly undercut by friends. To stay close, then, we unconsciously may repress other potential parts of ourselves. This is a major reason why recovery often takes longer than it needs to for many people.</p>

<p>Take the case of a young woman in therapy who was very fearful and avoided leaving the house. She wanted to have a job, but was too frightened. Her therapist noted to herself that abuse may have been responsible for the woman&rsquo;s current timidity, but focused with the client on her assets. It turned out that the client had a well-developed Altruist. She cared for herself and her children quite effectively. Together, she and her therapist realized that she needed to awaken her Warrior to be able to set boundaries.&#160;Before she could be ready for the work world, the woman had to become tougher. But she did feel as though she could sign up for a women&rsquo;s martial arts class. After focusing on developing her Warrior in such ways, the client eventually got a job.</p>

<p>Cathy came from a religious family&#8230; From her church, she picked up the impression that the only way she could be good enough was to be martyred like Christ or many of the great saints. She concluded that any concern for her own desires was selfish. Indeed, nothing she did ever was quite enough, because she was not perfect and no amount of ordinary altruism adds up to being crucified for others. Not only was she unhappy, she also felt guilty about feeling miserable.<br />
This deeply religious woman eventually gravitated to a church that was archetypally more balanced. Here she was taught that the divine could be found within as well as beyond. The minister also emphasized many aspects of Christ&rsquo;s life other than his death. Stories of Christ tossing the money changers out of the temple gave Cathy permission to awaken her Warrior. Stories about Christ going alone to the desert helped her know it was all right to embark on her own Wanderer journey, which she did by going off to read books that expanded her horizons. Stories about Christ feeding the multitudes and healing the sick inspired her to awaken her Magician. With more than one archetype active in her life, she achieved much greater fulfillment.<br />
As a result, she became a more authentically giving person. As long as she struggled against her own nature to care for others, she could not succeed. It was only when she learned to trust her own process&#160;that she could love others and give to them with sincere joy.</p>

<p>Every time we make a choice to continue in an environment or to seek a new one, we choose how we will be socialized in our immediate future.</p>

<p>mental illness can be a shadow side of the Magician.</p>

<p>Wherever a vacuum exists in a family&mdash;when some important archetype is missing or virtually absent&mdash;one of the children almost inevitably will be drawn to that archetype.<br />

<p>Deborah took a job in a sales operation with Warrior values, even though she was totally noncompetitive and unassertive. She hated the people she worked with and they treated her as marginal to the team. She was extremely unhappy in her job until she realized that she was there to develop her Warrior. When she started to show more toughness, she began to be treated more collegially by her co-workers.<br />
Organizations with archetypal structures opposite to your own can feel very uncomfortable, but they do help you balance out your archetypal wheel. Organizations that are an exact fit&mdash;archetypally unbalanced in the same way you are&mdash;will feel very comfortable to&#160;you, but will tend to retard your development. The ideal situation is the environment that is like you in enough ways to make you feel at home, but different enough to cause you to stretch.</p>

<p>Girls can cry pretty much all they want. But society comes down on them if they demonstrate much anger or desire to win, especially if it means someone else feels threatened or loses. (Girls are supposed to care more about others&rsquo; feelings than their own.) Therefore, girls repress their Warrior with an attendant suppression of anger and assertiveness. When they defer to others and swallow their anger and ambition, they are praised as examples of true femininity.</p>

<p>The alchemy of romantic love can help men and women awaken their repressed parts. To be close, people must be willing to show their vulnerabilities; they also must have good boundaries so that they can assert their own needs. This means that neither men nor women can have the love they want without leaving their psychological comfort zone. Typically, men need to develop the courage to risk showing where they are vulnerable, while women need to take the risk of threatening their men by being more outspoken about their wants and needs.</p>

<p>Exercise C: Notice what qualities attract you in the other sex... Pay special attention to the qualities that you believe you do not have. Could developing these qualities in yourself enhance your life and/or improve your romantic relationships?<br />
Notice also qualities you judge negatively in the other sex&mdash;whether as romantic partners, friends, or in any other area of your life. Often we disdain what we need to develop in ourselves. Can you see any way your life might be better if you became more androgynous?</p>

<p>+ Being assertive, ambitious, goal-oriented;<br />
- Being selfish, not caring about other's needs and feelings in the process of achieving their own goals and getting pleasure (Wanderer);</p>

<p>When the Warrior archetype is repressed, anyone, male or female, will be manipulative and/or passive aggressive. A wonderfully sweet young woman subtly criticizes her husband until, over time, he loses confidence and does whatever she wants. Or she becomes increasingly sick and helpless until others take care of her and follow her wishes. At work, while she never would take leadership directly, she may use gossip to elevate or undermine others, subtly taking power behind the scenes. Or she may project the Warrior archetype onto others, attaching herself to protectors who seem strong where she is weak. If we want peace, it is better to develop the Warrior archetype beyond its violent and ruthless potential, so that we can assert our own needs and work through conflict honestly and openly. Ironically, peace comes not through repressing the Warrior but through developing its higher expression.</p>

<p><b>Exercise D:</b> To identify the archetypal qualities you have repressed, make a list of all the people you judge negatively and determine which archetype they most resemble. </p>

<p> - irresponsible people - maybe I need more play and lightness in my own life (Wanderer)<br />
 - sexually promiscuous (Wanderer)<br />
 - narcissistic people (Wanderer)<br />
 - conflict-oriented people (Warrior)</p>

<p>&bull; If you cannot stand aggressive people, you undoubtedly will find yourself pushed around at some point. In fact, until you learn the lesson of the Warrior archetype, you will be faced with situation after situation that requires you to fight for yourself.</p>

<p>As we expand our own repertoire of behaviors and allow ourselves to be more whole, we attract to ourselves more interesting people&mdash;or we are able to understand how interesting other people have been all along. For example, many women who have been socialized to be competitive with other women think that other women typically are competitive, backbiting, and untrustworthy. As they begin to find value in their own femaleness, most of the women around them seem suddenly and quite miraculously to have become sisterly and honest. If this does not happen, they might then take responsibility for attracting shadow-possessed women, asking, &ldquo;What is this mirroring in me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we refuse to honor an archetype, we find ourselves in situation after situation that requires that gift.</p>

<p><b>Exercise E:</b> List the qualities you value in other cultures or groups and identify their archetypal roots. What do you judge negatively in other cultures or groups? Often we see the negative qualities of archetypes in others and their more positive manifestations in ourselves. You might use the following chart to stimulate your thinking&#160;about what archetypes may be calling you through your aversion to certain types of people. </p>

<h4>SEVEN STEPS TO ACTIVATING AN ARCHETYPE</h4>

<p>The first step is to identify the positive qualities of the archetype.<br />
Read books and watch television shows and movies based on that archetype. Put up photos, paintings, or posters that illustrate that archetype in your environment. Listen to music that evokes the archetype while you do your mundane tasks. &#8230; I strongly recommend keeping a journal or making a scrapbook detailing your findings.</p>

<p>The second step is to think consciously like the archetype you need.<br />
For example, perhaps you typically think like an Orphan and you want to awaken your Warrior. Every time you say to yourself, &ldquo;There is nothing I can do. I just have to live with this,&rdquo; quickly stop yourself and say, &ldquo;I have the strength and courage to follow through on standing up for myself and getting what I want.&rdquo; Then imagine yourself putting this new attitude into action.</p>

<p>Most importantly, make a habit of imagining yourself succeeding in expressing the archetype in your life.</p>

<p>The third step is to identify the cause of the inner block to expressing this archetype.</p>

<p>The fourth step is to begin talking the talk. Listen to yourself and consciously talk in ways congruent with the archetype you want to express in your life.</p>

<p>If you are hanging around with a crowd of people who bond around their wounds, practice saying positive, upbeat things instead. Go ahead and be cheerful, even if doing so feels a bit forced at first.</p>

<p>The fifth step is to be around archetypal role models.<br />
For instance, if you are awakening the Warrior archetype, you might sign up for a martial arts or assertiveness&#160;class, or take a job, volunteer, or engage in recreation in a Warrior culture environment. Archetypal energies are contagious.</p>

<p>To awaken the Innocent, &#8230; simply take time to enjoy and appreciate your life.</p>

<p>If you want miracles in your work life, find someone in your field of endeavor who seems magical to you and ask him or her to mentor you. Read books about new paradigm thinking and connect up with people whom you see as doing cutting-edge work. Volunteer or take a job with a work team that is committed to living its vision and values in everything it does.</p>

<p>The sixth step is to begin walking the talk.<br />
Think of this as method acting.</p>

<p>dress in a manner that calls up the archetype</p>

<p>Of course, the most important way to walk your talk is actually to begin doing what the archetype does. If, for example, you want more Warrior energy, stop letting small slights pass. Stand up for yourself or for others. If you want more Magician energy, seek win/win solutions.</p>

<p>The seventh and final step is to fine-tune your skills.&#160;When we are new to the Warrior stance, we may fight every battle that comes along. Veteran Warriors, however, choose their battles carefully, being willing to accept a short-term loss to gain long-term strategic advantage.</p>

<p>The more buried the archetype, the slower the process should be for awakening it. For example, in awakening the Warrior, you do not want to pick fights with everyone in sight. If you have some time to integrate the archetype into your life, it is good to express it first in an art form of some kind&mdash;a poem, song, painting, etc. The artistic process helps refine and integrate the archetype so that it does not emerge in your actions in an inappropriately primal way.</p>

<p>Often archetypes are awakened as a natural part of ongoing inner work. You may not even notice that you are engaged in activating an archetype. If you regularly record your dreams, look for archetypal figures in them. Often these figures are compensatory, expressing in your dreams what is missing from your life. As you identify these figures, they enter your conscious mind.<br />
In Jungian dream analysis, you might be encouraged to start reading about the mythic patterns that have emerged in your dreams. Even if you haven&rsquo;t been told to do this, it is not unusual for people to pick up intuitively on patterns in their dreams and begin to read books and see movies that express the same plot line. They may not notice that, after some time, this archetype is expressed naturally in what they think and do and say. For many, this is a largely unconscious process, yet it works.<br />
You also can look for archetypal patterns in your doodles, daydreams, fantasies, and journal entries. Any habit or practice that helps you stay conscious of your own inner life can keep you from getting stuck by revealing the archetypes that are knocking on your door, waiting to enter your conscious awareness. Remember that the archetypal figures that recur in your dreams and in spontaneous art are asking to be expressed in your life. If you let them, they do not have to create symptoms or problems to get your attention.</p>

<p>Exercise G: Keep a record of your dreams, doodles, and other imaginative expressions. Pay attention to which archetypes are calling for your attention in these ways.<br />
You may notice archetypes that are not included in this book. If so, do some research on them and, as you understand their meanings, experiment with integrating their perspectives into your life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER 10<br />
The Ethics of the Journey: The Code</h3>

<blockquote class="important"><p><q>Nor should it be forgotten that moral law is not just something imposed upon man from outside&#8230;. On the contrary, it expresses a psychic fact. As the regulator of action, it corresponds to a preformed image, a pattern of behavior which is archetypal and deeply imbedded in human nature.</q></p>
<p class="author">Erich Neumann,&#160;Depth Psychology and a New Ethic</p></blockquote>

<p>Joseph Campbell was fond of warning people that they can climb the ladder of success only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall. &#8230; If we never learn who we really are inside, we never will achieve true fulfillment. We find ourselves against the wrong wall anytime we are living by standards not our own.</p>

<p>Heroes always have a sense of social and historical responsibility&mdash;to leave the world better than they found it.&#160;</p>

<p>People&rsquo;s values differ not only because of their cultural and religious backgrounds but also because of their dominant archetypes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Inner Ally </th> <th> Success Is Being</th><th>Character Is</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Innocent</td> <td>Happy</td> <td>Being positive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orphan</td> <td>Safe and secure</td> <td>Protecting yourself from being hurt</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wanderer</td> <td>Yourself</td> <td>Acting authentically</td></tr>
<tr><td>Warrior</td> <td>Triumphant</td> <td>Doing right, avoiding wrong</td></tr>
<tr><td>Altruist</td> <td>Good</td> <td>Caring for others</td></tr>
<tr><td>Magician</td> <td>Transformative</td> <td>Living consciously</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The Wanderer also loves to explore difference, so this archetype helps us to learn from others with different values. The Wanderer can be tolerant of differing values as long as people are true to what they believe.</p>

<p>The Altruist prompts us to test our ethical ideals to see if they help or harm us and others. If our thinking is out of touch with human reality, we might subscribe to a belief that seems right abstractly, but in practice creates suffering. If so, the Altruist says it is not moral. In addition, Altruists encourage groups to come together to clarify their common values and seek common ground.</p>

<p>&#8230;the Magician brings a scientific approach to ethics,&#160;seeing life as a moral &ldquo;laboratory.&rdquo; ... Magicians also know that ethics are an inside job. If you want to be a positive force in the world, you always must begin by raising your own consciousness.</p>

<p>The archetypes also help us develop the inner strength required to live by a moral code:</p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>The Orphan helps us process our pain and disappointment when others betray or mistreat us, so that we do not lash out in anger or use addictions to numb ourselves;</li>
<li>The Wanderer prods us to stay the course of our own values rather than go along with the crowd;</li>
<li>The Warrior gives us the discipline and moral courage not to succumb to temptation;</li>
<li>The Altruist requires us to show compassion for ourselves and others, so that we do not want to do harmful things;</li>
<li>The Innocent provides us with the faith and optimism to believe that we do not need to compromise our integrity to succeed; and</li>
<li>The Magician helps us see that what we put out into the world always will come back to us, often in magnified form.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, if we want people to develop character, we must encourage them to take their journeys.</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise A:</b> Write your own code of ethics&#8230; Then examine any ways in which you have trouble living up to that code. In those cases, identify the archetype that might help you maintain your own standards.</p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>1. Be authentic </li>
<li>2. Be kind</li>
</ul>

<h4>THE HERO WITHIN MORAL CODE</h4>

<p>it comes down to one basic premise: honor everyone&rsquo;s heroic journey. </p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li> 1. See everyone as a hero on a journey.</li>
<li> 2. Free yourself from prejudices and stereotypes about others.</li>
<li>  3. Recognize the positive potential in negative situations.</li>
<li>  4. Model right action by staying true to your own path.</li>
 <li> 5. Respect interdependence.</li>
 </ul>

<p><i>Rule 1: See everyone as a hero on a journey.</i> <br />
 These theories should be used with respect for the individual journey, whether it is yours or someone else&rsquo;s. They never should be used to put someone else down for being at the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; place on the journey. &#8230; While this book provides a map to follow, it is the individual journey, not the map, that is important.<br />
Each journey is unique, and in that way it is a mystery. It also is useful in working with the material to let go of any sense that we know the next step in the journey&mdash;for ourselves or for others.<br />
Respect for the hero&rsquo;s journey requires us never to succumb to the arrogance of thinking that we know what someone can and cannot do.&#160;</p>

<p>Often, the best path may be a winding one, and we may appear to be heading quite the opposite way from where we ultimately will perch.&#160;</p>

<p><i>Rule 3: Recognize the positive potential in negative situations.</i> Anytime we meet the shadow of an archetype in another person, its positive pole has the potential to be expressed.</p>

<p>M. Scott Peck&rsquo;s <cite>People of the Lie</cite> defines as evil those who would rather harm another than see the truth about themselves. People also tend to do evil things when they avoid their journeys.</p>

<p>The following chart describes the immoral pole of each archetype. Generally, these are expressed when someone has not taken the journey of that archetype. James Hillman tells us that &ldquo;all our pathologies are calls from the gods.&rdquo; Morality is like homeopathic medicine. The antidote for the illness is from the same archetype&mdash;only in its more positive form. </p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Archetype</th> <th>Motivation for Wrongdoing</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Orphans</td> <td>Feel they have to do it to survive or protect themselves</td></tr>
<tr><td>Warriors</td> <td>Take immoral action to get greater power or a competitive advantage</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wanderers</td> <td>Think they are above ordinary laws and don&rsquo;t allow anyone to tell them what to do</td></tr>
<tr><td>Altruists</td> <td>Lash out in anger after they have sacrificed too much; shame others and make them feel guilty</td></tr>
<tr><td>Innocents</td> <td>Use the excuse that everyone does it, or just don&rsquo;t think about what they are doing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Magicians</td> <td>Manipulate others to get them to do what they want</p>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><i>Rule 4: Model right action by staying true to your own path.</i> <br />
If you truly want to help others, you must model fidelity to your own path. &#8230;<br />
I am sure you know people who have had a major impact on your life&mdash;less because of what they did than who they were. Every time you are true to the hero within, you help transform the world.</p>

<p><i>Rule 5: Respect interdependence.</i> Most people think of individuals as isolated entities, separate from the communities of which they are a part. This failure to think systemically causes us to conceive of people as the problem when the real issues are structural.</p>

<p>A college president... Like many strong leaders, she found the Orphan annoying and kept getting rid of staff who whined or found fault with everything. Eventually she discovered that this did no good, because soon someone else would begin reciting a litany of complaints. In other words, she realized that in any system, someone has to express the Orphan. If such voices are silenced or devalued, the result will be an increase in low-level (or shadow) expressions of the archetype. The leadership issue is not to get rid of the Orphan, but to create an environment that encourages its more positive expression.<br />
In utilizing archetypal theory ethically, it is important to remember that we all are radically interdependent&mdash;with our families, our friends, our co-workers, our communities, and the natural world. If an archetype is active around us, we are issued an invitation to enter its story. Generally, we cannot refuse to do so unless we leave the situation altogether. For example, if anyone in our vicinity is oppressed, we will have to deal with the Orphan archetype. We may feel too far along on our own journeys to need to do so, but the truth is that life is a communal experience.</p>

<p>When we think archetypally, we also can recognize the deep structure behind ideas in different fields that predominate in any historical period. When the Warrior archetype was dominant in Western culture, theology focused on the struggle between good and evil, biology emphasized the survival of the fittest, meetings were run along authoritarian lines by majority rule, and organizations took on hierarchical structures, like the military. As the Magician archetype emerges into consciousness, we see theologies emphasizing oneness, biology stressing ecological interdependence, meetings run according to rules of consensual decision making, and organizations becoming flatter and more egalitarian in structure.</p>

<p>Moreover, unless an archetype is expressed outside us in some way, it is very difficult for that archetype to be active in&#160;our&#160;lives. The hero within always is in dialogue with the hero without. Although the great majority of us are limited in what we can achieve by what is happening in the collective, any advance we do make affects the world way beyond ourselves.<br />
The journey may feel very lonely at times, but the truth is that we all are traveling in a caravan together. Whatever you are thinking or feeling, you have company. Archetypes do not emerge only in one person; they come first to a number of societal pioneers and more slowly to cultural leaders and others. Knowing this can give us courage.</p>

<p>&#160;let go of our fears that others are not ready to hear what we know</p>

<p>Recently I have heard some people complain about the lack of spirituality in the workplace. There is, of course, no lack of spirituality in our organizations. They are full of people with highly developed spiritual lives. It is just that to be taken seriously, most workers believe that from nine to five they have to pretend this is not so. All we need to bring spirituality back to the workplace is to break the ban on talking from our hearts, souls, and spirits.&#160;</p>

<h4>Appendix A: The Heroic Myth Self-Test</h4>

<p>Be aware that you may experience stress because of the difference between your own inner archetypal structure and that of the systems of which you are a part. This stress can be&#160;<br />
a stimulus to growth if it motivates you to awaken an archetype or its more positive aspects.&#160;What archetype, if awakened, could decrease the stress in your life?<br />
 - Warrior; Magician; <br />
 - Wanderer - currently its negative aspects are more prevalent in my life - loner, outsider etc; I need to awaken Wanderer's positive aspects:<br />
 a) pioneer - through starting a new endeavour;<br />
 b) being autonomous and independent - through travel I can learn to rely on myself, through new experiences I can become more adventurous;<br />
 c) a divergent thinker - through expressing new ideas and engaging in new experiences.<br />
 <br />
You also might experience stress because some important archetype is in shadow (repressed, punished, etc.) in any of the systems of which you are a part. What might that shadow archetype have to teach or tell you?<br />
 - Warrior is repressed to such an extent that I don't even exhibit its negative characteristics.<br />
 <br />
How can I awaken my Warrior?</p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>1. Doing a Warrior activity - like shooting, boxing etc.</li>
<li>2. Jumping to aggressive/extreme songs!</li>
<li>3. Expressing it through art - how? </li>
<li>4. Putting myself in an environment where I can develop my Warrior - where?</li>
<li> 5. Being assertive when I want something - just saying I want it may be enough in many situations.</li>
<li>6. Building stronger boundaries (I'm already doing it any time I say no).</li>
<li>7. Expressing my desire to win (I didn't have a problem with that at school).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Appendix B: Guidelines for Heroic Journey Support Groups</h4>

<p>&#8230;paying attention to the group process to be certain that the task does not get done at the cost of healthy relationships between members.</p>

<p>Take responsibility for trying to get your needs met. Do not assume that others (including any leader) can read your mind. Say what you want and need, but also be aware that you cannot always have everything you ask for (although asking certainly ups the chances of success).</p>

<p>Journeyers are equals. Even if your group has a designated leader, bring your full wisdom to the group. Do not disempower yourself by waiting for someone else to know what you know or see what you see. Often what we find missing in any group is what we alone could provide.</p>

<p>If you would like things to go a different way, don&rsquo;t just complain. Bring it up to the group as persuasively and constructively as you can.<br />
Take responsibility for your own participation or nonparticipation.&#160;</p>

<p class="important">Stay in touch with your deeper, wiser self to know whether or not you should be in this particular group. If you believe you should, then be as fully present as you can. If not, go where your heart leads you.</p>

<h4>HEROIC WORKPLACES</h4>
<p>For an organization to work optimally, the following must be in balance.</p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>Employees need to feel as secure as possible; ideally, they will have health insurance, retirement plans, and a sense that as long as they do a good job, the organization will do its best to keep them employed (Orphan).</li>
<li>Employees want to find and express their genuine talents, their wisdom, and the full range of their humanity; this means matching people to roles that reflect their authenticity (Wanderer).</li>
<li>Employees thrive in settings that provide reasonable incentives (raises, bonuses, recognition) for exemplary achievement and help for rising to meet new challenges (training, equipment, etc.) (Warrior).</li>
<li>Employees feel ennobled when they work for an organization that is doing something positive for the world and when all stakeholders (including employees and customers) are treated well (Altruist).</li>
<li>Employee morale typically soars when the organization and their role in it is congruent with their values and principles (Innocent).</li>
<li>Employees need to believe that they have a voice in what happens in the organization; ideally, each person feels as though he or she is at the center of the organization and everything he or she does matters to its future (Magician).</li>
</ul>
