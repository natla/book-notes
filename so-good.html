            <p>Of course, mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness: The many examples of
                well-respected but miserable workaholics support this claim. Accordingly, this main thread of my
                argument moves beyond the mere acquisition of useful skills and into the subtle art of investing
                the <i>career capital</i>this generates into the right types of traits in your working life.</p>

            <p>Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow <i>you</i> in your quest to become, in the words of my favorite
                Steve Martin quote, <q>so good that they can't ignore you.</q></p>

            ...move his focus away from finding the <i>right work</i> and toward <i>working right</i>...

            <h3>Rule #1: Don't Follow Your Passion</h3>

            <p><h4>Do What Steve Jobs Did, Not What He Said</h4></p>

            <strong>Conclusion #1: Career Passions Are Rare</strong>

            <p>“In the movies there’s this idea that you should just go for your dream,” Glass tells them. “But I don’t believe that.
                Things happen in stages.” Glass emphasizes that it takes time to get good at anything, recounting the many years
                it took him to master radio to the point where he had interesting options. “The key thing is to <em>force yourself through the work,
                    force the skills to come; that’s the hardest phase,</em>” he says.</p>

            <strong>Conclusion #2: Passion Takes Time</strong>
            <p>A job , in Wrzesniewski’s formulation, is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work,
                and a calling is work that’s an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity.</p>
            <p>the strongest predictor of an assistant seeing her work as a calling was the number of years spent on the job.
                In other words, the more experience an assistant had, the more likely she was to love her work.</p>
            <strong>Conclusion #3: Passion Is a Side Effect of Mastery</strong>
            <p>SDT [Self-Determination Theory] tells us that motivation, in the workplace or elsewhere, requires that you fulfill three basic psychological
                needs—factors described as the “nutriments” required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work:</p>
            <ul class="detail-list">
                <li>Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important</li>
                <li>Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do</li>
                <li>Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>working right trumps finding the right work</em></p>
            <p>
                the passion hypothesis convinces people that somewhere there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it,
                they’ll immediately recognize that this is the work they were meant to do . The problem, of course, is when they fail to find
                this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping and crippling self-doubt.
            </p>
            <p>Observing a few instances of a strategy working does not make it universally effective.</p>

            <h3>Rule #2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You (Or, the Importance of Skill)</h3>
            <p>two different approaches to thinking about work: the craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you’re producing in your job,
                and the passion mindset, a focus on what value your job offers you.</p>
            <blockquote class="important">
                <p>Here’s what I respect: creating something meaningful and then presenting it to the world</p>
                <p class="author">Jordan Tice</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>an obsessive focus on the quality of what you produce is the rule in professional music. “It trumps your appearance,
                your equipment, your personality, and your connections,” he explained.</p>
            <p><em>Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what
                the world can offer you . This mindset is how most people approach their working lives.</em></p>
            <p>I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus
                toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you. <em class="violet">That is, regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer.</em></p>
            <p><em>The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills
                to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.</em></p>
            <p>if you just show up and work hard, you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.</p>
            <p>If you can figure out how to integrate <em>deliberate practice</em> into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past
                your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>The Five Habits of a Craftsman</h4>
                <ul class="detail-list">
                    <li>Step 1: Decide What Capital Market You’re In</li>
                    <p>There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction. In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type
                        of career capital available, and lots of different people competing for it. Television writing is a winner-take-all market
                        because all that matters is your ability to write good scripts. That is, the only capital type is your script-writing capability.
                        An auction market, by contrast, is less structured: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might
                        generate a unique collection. The cleantech space is an auction market.</p>
                    <p>Mistaking a winner-take-all for an auction market is common. I see it often in an area relevant to my own life: blogging.</p>
                    <p>When you correctly understand the market where blogging exists, you stop calculating your bounce rate and start focusing instead
                        on saying something people really care about—which is where your energy should be if you want to succeed.</p>
                    <li>Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type</li>
                    <p>If you’re in a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: By definition, there’s only one type of capital that matters.
                        For an auction market, however, you have flexibility. A useful heuristic in this situation is to seek open gates— opportunities
                        to build capital that are already open to you.</p>
                    <p>The advantage of open gates is that they get you farther faster, in terms of career capital acquisition, than starting from scratch.
                        It helps to think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing
                        its track once it’s moving is easy. In other words, it’s hard to start from scratch in a new field.</p>
                    <li>Step 3: Define “Good”</li><br>
                    <li>Step 4: Stretch and Destroy</li>
                    <p>Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands…
                        Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it “deliberate,” as distinct
                        from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in.</p>
                    <p>I like the term “stretch” for describing what deliberate practice feels like</p>
                    <p>this stretching feels much different than applying a technique you’ve already mastered, which can be quite enjoyable.
                        But this stretching, as any mathematician will also admit, is the precondition to getting better.</p>
                    <p>Pushing past what’s comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part
                        is embracing honest feedback—even if it destroys what you thought was good.</p>
                    <li>Step 5: Be Patient</li>
                    <p>it’s less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits
                        that pop up along the way to distract you.</p>
                    <p>This is why Martin’s diligence is so important: Without this patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits,
                        you’ll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital you need. I think the image of Martin returning to his banjo, day after day,
                        for forty years, is poignant. It captures well the feel of how career capital is actually acquired: You stretch yourself, day after day,
                        month after month, before finally looking up and realizing, “Hey, I’ve become pretty good, and people are starting to notice.”</p>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (Or, the Importance of Control)</h3>
            <p><em>control over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work you love.</em></p>
            <p>If you want to observe the power of control up close in the workplace, look toward companies embracing a radical new philosophy called Results-Only Work Environment
                (or, ROWE, for short). In a ROWE company, all that matters is your results. When you show up to work and when you leave, when you take vacations,
                and how often you check e-mail are all irrelevant. They leave it to the employee to figure out whatever works best for getting the important things done.
                “No results, no job: It’s that simple,”</p>
            <p>Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.</p>
            <p>To summarize, if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital
                in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment.</p>
            <p><em>it’s dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange.</em></p>

            <p><strong>The First Control Trap</strong></p>
            <p><i>Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.</i></p>

            <p><strong>The Second Control Trap</strong></p> <p><i>The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control
                over your working life is exactly the point when you’ve become valuable enough to your current employer that they will
                try to prevent you from making the change.</i></p>
            <p><em>once you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, you have become valuable enough
                to your employer that they will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy.</em></p>
            <p>Throughout her career, Lulu repeatedly fought to gain more freedom in her working life, sometimes to the shock or dismay
                of her employers or friends. “People tell me that I don’t do things the way other people do,” Lulu said. “But I tell them, ‘I’m not other people.’ ”</p>
            <p>This is the irony of control. When no one cares what you do with your working life, you probably don’t have enough career capital to do anything interesting.
                But once you do have this capital... you’ve become valuable enough that your employer will resist your efforts.</p>
            <p>in most jobs you should expect your employer to resist your move toward more control; they have every incentive to try to convince you
                to reinvest your career capital back into your career at their company, obtaining more money and prestige instead of more control,
                and this can be a hard argument to resist.</p>

            <p><strong>The Law of Financial Viability</strong>
            <p><i>When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life,
            seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.</i></p>
            <blockquote class="important">
                <p>I have this principle about money that overrides my other life rules. Do what people are willing to pay for.</p>
                <p class="author">Derek Sivers</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>“Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable.”
                He also emphasized that hobbies are clearly exempt from this rule. “If I want to learn to scuba dive, for example,
                because I think it’s fun, and people won’t pay me to do that, I don’t care, I’m going to do it anyway,” he said.
                But when it comes to decisions affecting your core career, money remains an effective judge of value. “If you’re struggling
                to raise money for an idea, or are thinking that you will support your idea with unrelated work, then you need to rethink the idea.”</p>


            <h3>Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big (Or, the Importance of Mission)</h3>
            <p><em>a unifying mission to your working life can be a source of great satisfaction.</em></p>

            <p>One of the first things you’ll notice if you spend time around Pardis is that she enjoys her life.
                Biology, like any high-stakes academic field, is demanding. Because of this it has a reputation for turning young professors
                into curmudgeons who adopt a masochistic brand of workaholism, in which relaxation becomes a sign of failure and the accomplishments
                of peers become tragedies. This can be a bleak existence. Pardis, for her part, has avoided this fate.</p>
            <p>her happiness comes from the fact that she built her career on a clear and compelling mission— something
                that not only gives meaning to her work but provides the energy needed to embrace life beyond the lab.</p>
            <p>Pardis’s career is driven by a clear mission: to use new technology to fight old diseases.</p>
            <p>Staying up late to save your corporate litigation client a few extra million dollars can be draining, but
                <em class="violet">staying up
                late to help cure an ancient disease can leave you more energized than when you started—perhaps even providing
                the extra enthusiasm needed to start a lab volleyball team or tour with a rock band.</em></p>
            <h4>Missions Require Capital</h4>
            <p><em>a mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable.</em></p>
            <p>A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the <strong>adjacent
                possible</strong> of your field. If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, <em>you must first get
                to the cutting edge</em>—the only place where these missions become visible.</p>
            <p>If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world
                would be commonplace. But it’s not commonplace; it’s instead quite rare. This rareness, we now understand, is because these
                breakthroughs require that you first get to the cutting edge, and this is hard—the type of hardness that most of us
                try to avoid in our working lives.</p>
            <p>Getting to the cutting edge of a field can be understood in these terms: This process builds up rare and valuable skills
                and therefore builds up your store of career capital. Similarly, identifying a compelling mission once you get to the cutting edge
                can be seen as investing your career capital to acquire a desirable trait in your career. In other words, mission is yet another
                example of career capital theory in action. If you want a mission, you need to first acquire capital.</p>
            <h4>Missions Require Little Bets</h4>
            <p>great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of <em>using small and achievable projects—little bets—to explore
                the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.</em></p>
            <p>The important thing about little bets is that they’re bite-sized. You try one. It takes a few months at most. It either succeeds or fails,
                but either way you get important feedback to guide your next steps. This approach stands in contrast to the idea of choosing a bold plan
                and making one big bet on its success.</p>
            <p>If career capital makes it possible to identify a compelling mission, then it’s a strategy of little bets that gives you a good shot
                of succeeding in this mission.</p>
            <h4>Missions Require Marketing</h4>
            <p><i>great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of finding projects that satisfy the <strong>law of remarkability</strong>,
                which requires that an idea inspires people to remark about it, and is launched in a venue where such remarking is made easy.</i></p>

            <h4>The Remarkable Life of Giles Bowkett</h4>
            <p>Giles committed himself to the mission of bringing together the worlds of art and Ruby programming.</p>
            <p>A career untamed, he realized, can bring you into dangerous territory, such as being bored while writing computer code for an investment bank.
                He needed a mission to actively guide his career or he would end up trapped again and again. He decided that a good mission for him would somehow
                combine the artistic and technical sides of his life, but he didn’t know how to make this general idea into a money-making reality</p>

            <blockquote class="important">
            <p>The world is full of boring stuff—brown cows—which is why so few people pay attention. … A purple cow… now that would stand out.
                Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing.</p>
                <p class="author">Seth Godin</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>When Giles read Godin’s book, he had an epiphany: For his mission to build a sustainable career, it had to produce purple cows,
                the type of remarkable projects that compel people to spread the word.</p>

            <p>a good mission-driven project must be remarkable in two different ways. First, it should be remarkable in the literal sense
                of compelling people to remark about it.</p>

            <p>[Giles Bowkett] also spread the word about the project in a venue that supports these remarks. In his case, this venue was the open-source software community.
                As he learned from Chad Fowler, there’s an established infrastructure in this community for noticing and spreading the word about interesting projects.
                Without this conduciveness to chatter, a purple cow, though striking, may never be seen. To be more concrete, if Giles had instead released Archaeopteryx
                as a closed-source piece of commercial software, perhaps trying to sell it from a slick website or at music conventions, it probably wouldn’t have caught
                fire as it did.</p>

            <p><strong>The Law of Remarkability </strong></p>
            <p><i>For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be <strong>remarkable</strong> in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark
                about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking</i></p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Most knowledge workers avoid the uncomfortable strain of deliberate practice like the plague, a reality emphasized by the typical cubicle dweller’s
                obsessive e-mail–checking habit—for what is this behavior if not an escape from work that’s more mentally demanding?</p>
            <p>True missions, it turns out, require two things. First you need career capital, which requires patience. Second, you need to be ceaselessly
                scanning your always-changing view of the adjacent possible in your field, looking for the next big idea. This requires a dedication to brainstorming
                and exposure to new ideas. Combined, these two commitments describe a lifestyle, not a series of steps that automatically spit out a mission when completed.</p>
