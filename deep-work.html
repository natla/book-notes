			<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>Deep Work:</b>&#160;Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</p>

<p>&#8230;Neal Stephenson, the acclaimed cyberpunk author who helped form our popular conception of the Internet age, is near impossible to reach electronically&mdash;his website offers no e-mail address and features an essay about why he is purposefully bad at using social media. Here&rsquo;s how he once explained the omission: &ldquo;If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. [If I instead get interrupted a lot] what replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time&#8230; there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Shallow Work:</b>&#160;Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.</p>

<p>The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook (a shallow task, easily replicated), but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative distributed systems that run the service (a decidedly deep task, hard to replicate).&#160;</p>

<p><b>The Deep Work Hypothesis:</b>&#160;The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly <i>rare</i> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly <i>valuable</i> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.</p>

<p>My commitment to depth has also returned nonprofessional benefits. For the most part, I don&rsquo;t touch a computer between the time when I get home from work and the next morning when the new workday begins (the main&#160;exception being blog posts, which I like to write after my kids go to bed). This ability to fully disconnect, as opposed to the more standard practice of sneaking in a few quick work e-mail checks, or giving in to frequent surveys of social media sites, allows me to be present with my wife and two sons in the evenings, and read a surprising number of books for a busy father of two. More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people&rsquo;s daily lives. I&rsquo;m comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding skill&mdash;especially on a lazy D.C. summer night listening to a Nationals game slowly unfold on the radio.</p>

<h2> PART 1 <br />The Idea</h2>

<h3>Chapter One <br />Deep Work Is Valuable</h3>

<h4> The High-Skilled Workers</h4>

<p>Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-skilled positions, but as these economists emphasize, &ldquo;other technologies like data visualization, analytics, high speed communications, and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, increasing the values of these jobs.&rdquo; In other words, those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive. Tyler Cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: &ldquo;The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>The Superstars</h4>

<p>High-speed data networks and collaboration tools like e-mail and virtual meeting software have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of knowledge work. It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world&rsquo;s best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time to complete the project at hand. In this scenario, you&rsquo;ll probably get a better result for less money, while Hansson can service many more clients per year, and will therefore also end up better off. The fact that Hansson might be working remotely from Marbella, Spain, while your office is in Des Moines, Iowa, doesn&rsquo;t matter to your company, as advances in communication and collaboration technology make the process near seamless. (This reality does matter, however, to the less-skilled local programmers living in Des Moines and in need of a steady paycheck.) This same trend holds for the growing number of fields where technology makes productive remote work possible&mdash;consulting, marketing, writing, design, and so on. Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.&rdquo; -Sherwin Rosen</p>

<p>The small company looking for a computer programmer or public relations consultant now has access to an international marketplace of talent in the same way that the advent of the record store allowed the small-town music fan to bypass local musicians to buy albums from the world&rsquo;s best bands. The superstar effect, in other words, has a broader application today&#8230;</p>

<h4>The Owners</h4>

<p>A venture capitalist in today&rsquo;s economy can fund a company like Instagram, which was eventually sold for a billion dollars, while employing&#160;only thirteen people. When else in history could such a small amount of labor be involved in such a large amount of value?</p>

<p> &#8230;Current economic thinking, as I&rsquo;ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented&#160;growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.</p>

<em>&#160;If you can join any of these groups, therefore, you&rsquo;ll do well. </em>

<p>I just identified two groups that are poised to thrive and that I claim are accessible: those who can work creatively with intelligent machines and those who are stars in their field.</p>

<div class="important">
<h4>Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy</h4>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>1. The ability to quickly master hard things. </li>
<li>2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&#8230;intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.   The complex reality of the technologies that real companies leverage to get ahead emphasizes the absurdity of the now common idea that exposure to simplistic, consumer-facing products&mdash;especially in schools&mdash;somehow prepares people to succeed in a high-tech economy. Giving students iPads or allowing them to film homework assignments on YouTube prepares them for a high-tech economy about as much as playing with Hot Wheels would prepare them to thrive as auto mechanics.</p>

<p>Now consider the second core ability from the list shown earlier: producing at an elite level. If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not&#160;sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.</p>

<p>&#8230;If you don&rsquo;t produce, you won&rsquo;t thrive&mdash;no matter how skilled or talented you are.</p>

<h4>Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things</h4>

<p>&#8230;what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you&rsquo;re trying to improve or an idea you&rsquo;re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it&rsquo;s most productive.</p>

<p>&#8230;neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people&rsquo;s improvements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book,&#160;The Talent Code, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin&mdash;a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. <em>To be great at something is to be well myelinated.</em></p>

<p>By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you&rsquo;re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits&mdash;effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it&rsquo;s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you&rsquo;re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you&rsquo;re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen.</p>

<p><em>To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.</em></p>

<h4>Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level</h4>

<p><strong> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)</strong></p>

<p>By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working.</p>

<p>&#8230;the very best students often studied less than the group of students right below them on the GPA rankings. One of the explanations for this phenomenon turned out to be the formula detailed earlier: The best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration&mdash;radically reducing the time required to prepare for tests or write papers, without diminishing the quality of their results.</p>

<p><i><a class="detail-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399" target="_blank">attention residue</a></i><br /> (Sophie Leroy, a business professor at the University of Minnesota) <br />&#8230;in the modern knowledge work office, once you got to a high enough level, it was more common to find people working on multiple projects sequentially: &ldquo;Going from one meeting to the next, starting to work on one project and soon after having to transition to another is just part of life in organizations,&rdquo; Leroy explains. The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn&rsquo;t immediately follow&mdash;a&#160;residue&#160;of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.&#160;</p>

<p>&#8230;People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate&#160;poor performance on that next task,&rdquo; and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.</p>

<p>By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task. When Grant is working for days in isolation on a paper, in other words, he&rsquo;s doing so at a higher level of effectiveness than the standard professor following a more distracted strategy in which the work is repeatedly interrupted by residue-slathering interruptions.</p>

<p>&#8230;the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance.&#160;It might seem harmless to take a quick glance at your inbox every ten minutes or so. ... That quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at the moment (which is almost always the case), you&rsquo;ll be forced to turn back to the primary task with a secondary task left unfinished. The&#160;attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.</p>

<div class="important">
<h4>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.</h4>
</div>

<h3> Chapter Two <br />Deep Work Is Rare</h3>

<p>Open offices, for example, might create more opportunities for collaboration,&#160;but they do so at the cost of &ldquo;massive distraction,&rdquo; to quote the results of experiments conducted for a British TV special titled&#160;The Secret Life of Office Buildings. &ldquo;If you are just getting into some work and a phone goes off in the background, it ruins what you are concentrating on,&rdquo; said the neuroscientist who ran the experiments for the show. &ldquo;Even though you are not aware at the time, the brain responds to distractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>E-mail inboxes, in theory, can distract you only when you choose to open them, whereas instant messenger systems are meant to be always active&mdash;magnifying the impact of interruption. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, is an expert on the science of attention fragmentation. In a well-cited study, Mark and her co-authors observed knowledge workers in real offices and found that an interruption, even if short, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction. &ldquo;This was reported by subjects as being very detrimental,&rdquo; she summarized with typical academic understatement.</p>

<blockquote class="important"><p>Twitter is crack for media addicts. It scares me, not because I&rsquo;m morally superior to it, but because I don&rsquo;t think I could handle it. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;d end up letting my son go hungry.</p> <p class="author">George Packer<br /> <cite>New Yorker staff writer</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>[Tom Cochran, the chief technology officer of Atlantic Media] Just how much time were employees of Atlantic Media spending moving around information instead of focusing on the specialized tasks they were hired to perform? Determined to answer this question, Cochran gathered company-wide statistics on e-mails sent per day and the average number of words per e-mail. He then combined these numbers with the employees&rsquo; average typing speed, reading speed, and salary. The result: He discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a million dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails, with every message sent or received tapping the company for around ninety-five cents of labor costs. &ldquo;A &lsquo;free and frictionless&rsquo; method of communication,&rdquo; Cochran summarized, &ldquo;had soft costs equivalent to procuring a small company Learjet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>The Principle of Least Resistance:</b>&#160;In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.</p>

<p>To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because&#160;it&rsquo;s easier. There are at least two big reasons why this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your needs. If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier&mdash;at least, in the moment. If you couldn&rsquo;t count on this quick response time you&rsquo;d instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term). The second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox&mdash;responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive... If e-mail were to move to the periphery of your workday, you&rsquo;d be required to deploy a more thoughtful approach to figuring out what you should be working on and for how long. This type of planning is hard. </p>

<p>&#8230;consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes&#160;impossible. Why do they persist?&#160;They&rsquo;re easier.&#160;For many, these standing meetings become a simple (but blunt) form of personal organization. Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible simulacrum [&#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1086;&#1073;&#1080;&#1077;] of progress.</p>

<p>The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.</p>

<h3>Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity</h3>

<blockquote class="important"><p>To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time&#8230; it needs a lot of concentration&#8230; if you have a job administrating anything, you don&rsquo;t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I&rsquo;m irresponsible. I&rsquo;m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don&rsquo;t do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, &ldquo;no,&rdquo; I tell them: I&rsquo;m irresponsible.</p> <p class="author">Richard Feynman<br /><cite>Nobel Prize&ndash;winning physicist</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Feynman was adamant in avoiding administrative duties because he knew they would only decrease his ability to do the one thing that mattered most in his professional life: &ldquo;to do real good physics work. Feynman, we can assume, was probably bad at responding to e-mails and would likely switch universities if you had tried to move him into an open office or demand that he tweet. Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.</p>

<p>As [Matthew] Crawford describes in his 2009 ode to the trades,&#160;Shop Class as Soulcraft, he quit his job as a Washington, D.C., think tank director to open a motorcycle repair shop exactly to escape this bewilderment. The feeling of taking a broken machine, struggling with it, then eventually enjoying a tangible indication that he had succeeded (the bike driving out of the shop under its own power) provides a concrete sense of accomplishment he struggled to replicate when his day revolved vaguely around reports and communications strategies.</p>

<p><b>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity:</b>&#160;In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</p>

<p>If you send and answer e-mails at all hours, if you schedule and attend meetings constantly, if you weigh in on instant message systems like Hall within seconds when someone poses a new question, or if you roam your open office bouncing ideas off all whom you encounter&mdash;all of these behaviors make you seem busy in a public manner. If you&rsquo;re using busyness as a proxy for productivity, then these behaviors can seem crucial for convincing yourself and others that you&rsquo;re doing your job well.</p>

<p>&#160;In 2013, for example, Yahoo&rsquo;s new CEO Marissa Mayer banned employees from working at home. She made this decision after checking the server logs for the virtual private network that&#160;Yahoo employees use to remotely log in to company servers. Mayer was upset because the employees working from home didn&rsquo;t sign in enough throughout the day. She was, in some sense, punishing her employees for not spending more time checking e-mail (one of the primary reasons to log in to the servers). &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not visibly busy,&rdquo; she signaled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;re not productive.&rdquo; Viewed objectively, however, this concept is anachronistic. Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that&rsquo;s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it.&#160;</p>

<h3>The Cult of the Internet</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in&#160;Brave New World,&rdquo; he [Neil Postman] argued in his 1993 book on the topic. &ldquo;It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We no longer see Internet tools as products released by for-profit companies, funded by investors hoping to make a return, and run by twentysomethings who are often making things up as they go along. We&rsquo;re instead quick to idolize these digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new world.</p>

<p>This Internet-centrism (to steal another Morozov term) is what technopoly looks like today. ... The&#160;New York Times maintains a social media desk and pressures its writers, like Alissa Rubin, toward distracting behavior, because in an Internet-centric technopoly such behavior is not up for discussion. The alternative, to not embrace all things Internet, is, as Postman would say, &ldquo;invisible and therefore irrelevant.&rdquo; This invisibility explains the uproar, mentioned earlier, that arose when Jonathan Franzen dared suggest that novelists shouldn&rsquo;t tweet. It riled people not because they&rsquo;re well versed in book marketing and disagreed with Franzen&rsquo;s conclusion, but because it surprised them that anyone serious would suggest the irrelevance of social media. In an Internet-centric technopoly such a statement is the equivalent of a flag burning&mdash;desecration, not debate.</p>

<div class="important">
<h4>Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological.</h4>
</div>

<h4>Bad for Business. Good for You.</h4>

<p>The myopia&#160;of your peers and employers uncovers a great personal advantage. Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable.&#160;</p>

<h3>Chapter Three <br />Deep Work Is Meaningful</h3>

<p>Craftsmen like Furrer tackle professional challenges that are simple to define but difficult to execute&mdash;a useful imbalance when seeking purpose.&#160;Knowledge work exchanges this clarity for ambiguity. It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another: On our worst days, it can seem that&#160;all&#160;knowledge work boils down to the same exhausting roil of e-mails and PowerPoint,&#160;with only the charts used in the slides differentiating one career from another. Furrer himself identifies this blandness when he writes: &ldquo;The world of information superhighways and cyber space has left me rather cold and disenchanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thesis of this final chapter in Part 1, therefore, is that a deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.</p>

<h4>A Neurological Argument for Depth</h4>

<p>[Winifred Gallagher, a science writer, stumbled onto a connection between attention and happiness after a cancer diagnosis]</p>

<p>&#8230;the role that attention&mdash;that is, what we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore&mdash;plays in defining the quality of our life.</p>

<p>We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our&#160;circumstances, assuming that what happens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we feel. From this perspective, the small-scale details of how you spend your day aren&rsquo;t that important, because what matters are the large-scale outcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on&#160;what we pay attention to. If you focus on a cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant&mdash;even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same. As Gallagher summarizes: &ldquo;Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love&mdash;is the sum of what you focus on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their&#160;attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.</p>

<p>...your world is the outcome of what you pay attention to, so consider for a moment the type of mental world constructed when you dedicate significant time to deep endeavors. There&rsquo;s a gravity and sense of importance inherent in deep work&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re Ric Furrer smithing a sword or a computer programmer optimizing an algorithm. Gallagher&rsquo;s theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.</p>

<p>&#8230;Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives. (The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#8230; explicitly identifies this advantage when he emphasizes the advantage of cultivating &ldquo;concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.&rdquo;) This danger is especially pronounced in knowledge work, which due to its dependence on ubiquitous connectivity generates a devastatingly appealing buffet of distraction&mdash;most of which will, if given enough attention,&#160;leach meaning and importance from the world constructed by your mind.</p>

<p>The world represented by your inbox&#8230; isn&rsquo;t a pleasant world to inhabit.</p>

<p>&#160;&ldquo;&lsquo;the idle mind is the devil&rsquo;s workshop&rsquo;&#8230; when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After running my tough experiment [with cancer]&#8230; I have a plan for living the rest of my life,&rdquo; Gallagher concludes in her book. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose my targets with care&#8230; then give them my rapt attention. In short, I&rsquo;ll live the focused life, because it&rsquo;s the best kind there is.&rdquo; We&rsquo;d be wise to follow her lead.</p>

<h4>A Psychological Argument for Depth</h4>

<p>[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]</p>

<p>&#8230;&ldquo;The best moments usually occur when a person&rsquo;s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.&rdquo; Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state&#160;flow&#160;(a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). At the time, this finding pushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s ESM studies reveal that most people have this wrong: Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one&rsquo;s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8230;the more such flow experiences that occur in a given week, the higher the subject&rsquo;s life satisfaction. Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.</p>

<p>Gallagher&rsquo;s writing emphasizes that the&#160;content&#160;of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we&rsquo;ll experience our working life as more important and positive. Csikszentmihalyi&rsquo;s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is&#160;in itself&#160;very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject.</p>

<p>&#8230;Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by Csikszentmihalyi to describe what generates flow include notions of stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity&mdash;all of which also describe deep work).</p>

<p>Csikszentmihalyi even goes so far as to argue that modern companies should embrace this reality, suggesting that &ldquo;jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.&rdquo;&#160;&#8230;Csikszentmihalyi then explains that it&rsquo;s even more important that the&#160;individual&#160;learn how to seek out opportunities for flow. &#8230;<em>To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.</em></p>

<h4>A Philosophical Argument for Depth</h4>

<p>[Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly, All Things Shining, 2011]</p>

<p>In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked&#160;ourselves&#160;to identify what&rsquo;s meaningful and what&rsquo;s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. &ldquo;The Enlightenment&rsquo;s metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,&rdquo; Dreyfus and Kelly worry; &ldquo;it leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book&rsquo;s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. To illustrate this claim, they use as an organizing example an account of a master wheelwright&mdash;the now lost profession of shaping wooden wagon wheels. &ldquo;Because each piece of wood is distinct, it has its own personality,&rdquo; they write after a passage describing the details of the wheelwright&rsquo;s craft. &ldquo;The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.&rdquo; In this appreciation for the &ldquo;subtle&#160;virtues&rdquo; of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn&rsquo;t decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it&rsquo;s meant to perform. The task of a craftsman, they conclude, &ldquo;is not to&#160;generate&#160;meaning, but rather to&#160;cultivate&#160;in himself the skill of&#160;discerning&#160;the meanings that are&#160;already there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look of satisfaction on Furrer&rsquo;s face as he works to extract artistry from crude metals, these philosophers would argue, is a look expressing appreciation for something elusive and valuable in modernity: a glimpse of the sacred.</p>

<p>To elaborate this point, let&rsquo;s jump from the old-fashioned examples of carving wood or smithing metal to the modern example of computer programming. Consider this quote from the coding prodigy Santiago Gonzalez describing his work to an interviewer:  Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s well written code.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s much like as if you were writing a poem.   The Pragmatic Programmer&#8230; makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker&rsquo;s creed in its preface: &ldquo;We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.&rdquo; The book then elaborates that computer programmers must see their work in the same way:  Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship&#8230; One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as&#160;archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today&rsquo;s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.</p>

<p>Our obsession with the advice to &ldquo;follow your passion&rdquo; (the subject of my last book), for example, is motivated by the (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose. In this way of thinking, there are some rarified jobs that can be a source of satisfaction&mdash;perhaps working in a nonprofit or starting a software company&mdash;while all others are soulless and bland. The philosophy of Dreyfus and Kelly frees us from such traps. The craftsmen they cite don&rsquo;t have rarified jobs. Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn&rsquo;t glamorous. But&#160;this doesn&rsquo;t matter, as the specifics of the work are irrelevant. The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanship&mdash;not the outcomes of their work. Put another way, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work. </p>

<p>&#8230;cultivating craftsmanship is necessarily a deep task and therefore requires a commitment to deep work. (Recall that I argued in Chapter 1 that deep work is necessary to hone skills and to then apply them at an elite level&mdash;the core activities in craft.) Deep work, therefore, is key to extracting meaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus and Kelly.</p>

<h2>PART 2 <br />The Rules</h2>

<h3> Rule #1 Work Deeply</h3>

<p>&#160;The Eudaimonia Machine &#8230; which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of&#160;eudaimonia&#160;(a state in which you&rsquo;re achieving your full human potential), turns out to be a building. &ldquo;The goal of the machine,&rdquo; David explained, &ldquo;is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing&mdash;creating work that&rsquo;s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.&rdquo; It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. </p>

<p>We instead find ourselves in distracting open offices where inboxes cannot be neglected and meetings are incessant&mdash;a setting where colleagues would rather you respond quickly to their latest e-mail than produce the best possible results. As a reader of this book, in other words, you&rsquo;re a disciple of depth in a shallow world.</p>

<h4>The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling</h4>

<p>(Donald Knuth, Neal Stephenson)</p>

<blockquote class="important"><p>I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I&rsquo;d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.</p> <p class="author">Donald Knuth</p></blockquote>

<p>Stephenson sees two mutually exclusive options: He can write good novels at a regular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and attend conferences, and as a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower rate. He chose the former option, and this choice requires him to avoid as much as possible any source of shallow work in his professional life.&#160;</p>

<h4>The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling</h4>

<p>(Carl Jung, Adam Grant)</p>

<p>This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically&mdash;seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).</p>

<p>&#8230;the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.</p>

<h4>The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling</h4>

<p>This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a&#160;rhythm&#160;for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you&rsquo;re going to go deep. The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big red&#160;Xs on the calendar.</p>

<p>Another common way to implement the rhythmic philosophy is to replace the visual aid of the chain method with a set starting time that you use every day for deep work.</p>

<p>(Brian Chappell)</p>

<p>He made a rule that he would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon pushed his wake-up time to four forty-five to squeeze out even more morning depth.</p>

<p>His routine was&#160;producing four to five pages of academic prose per day and was capable of generating drafts of thesis chapters at a rate of one chapter&#160;every two or three weeks: a phenomenal output for someone who also worked a nine-to-five job.&#160;</p>

<h4>The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling</h4>

<p>(Walter Isaacson&#160;)</p>

<h3>Ritualize</h3>

<p>There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration&mdash;that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where&#8230; but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps&#160;the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration. -Mason Currey</p>

<p>In a&#160;New York Times&#160;column on the topic, David Brooks summarizes this reality more bluntly: &ldquo;[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously.</p>
<ul class="detail-list">
<li>
<b>Where you&rsquo;ll work and for how long.</b></li> <li><b>How you&rsquo;ll work once you start to work.</b> Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any Internet use, or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, you&rsquo;ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you&rsquo;re working sufficiently hard. </li>
<li><b>How you&rsquo;ll support your work.</b> Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking&#160;to help keep the mind clear. (As Nietzsche said: &ldquo;It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.&rdquo;)&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p> This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a&#160;hub-and-spokearchitecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported. It&rsquo;s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.</p>

<h3>Execute Like a Business</h3>

<h4>The 4 Disciplines of Execution</h4>

<p><b>Discipline #1:</b> Focus on the Wildly Important</p>

<p>As the authors of&#160;The 4 Disciplines of Execution&#160;explain, &ldquo;The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.&rdquo; They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of &ldquo;wildly important goals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. </p>

<p>In a 2014 column titled &ldquo;The Art of Focus,&rdquo; David Brooks endorsed this approach of letting ambitious goals drive focused behavior, explaining: &ldquo;If you want to win the war for attention, don&rsquo;t try to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Discipline #2:</b> Act on the Lead Measures</p>

<p>lag measures (results) vs. lead measures (process)</p>

<p>Lead measures&#8230; &ldquo;measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an individual focused on deep work, it&rsquo;s easy to identify the relevant lead measure:&#160;time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.</p>

<p><b>Discipline #3:</b> Keep a Compelling Scoreboard</p>

<p>[In Scrum this is the Burn-Down chart]</p>

<p><b>Discipline #4:</b> Create a Cadence of Accountability</p>

<p>[Example: the daily Scrum meetings]</p>

<p>For an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, &#8230; I discuss and recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead.&#160;</p>

<p>&#8230;it was not so much the <i>intensity</i> of my deep work periods that increased, but instead their <i>regularity</i>.&#160;</p>

<h3>Be Lazy</h3>

<blockquote class="important">
<p>Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets&#8230; it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.</p> <p class="author">Tim Kreider<br /><cite>essayist and cartoonist</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>This strategy argues that you should follow Kreider&rsquo;s lead by injecting regular and substantial freedom from professional concerns into your day, providing you with the idleness paradoxically required to get (deep) work done. &#8230;At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning&mdash;no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you&rsquo;ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free to encounter Kreider&rsquo;s buttercups, stink bugs, and stars.</p>

<p>Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)&mdash;an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move around more information and sift through more potential solutions than your&#160;conscious centers of thinking. Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like Google&rsquo;s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions.</p>

<p>&#8230;attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.</p>

<p>Put another way, when walking through nature, you&rsquo;re freed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and experience enough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention. This state allows your directed attention resources time to replenish.</p>

<p>Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they provide similar &ldquo;inherently fascinating stimuli&rdquo; and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run&mdash;the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening&#160;if you enforce a work shutdown&mdash;play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature. On the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you&rsquo;re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you from reaching the levels of deeper relaxation in which attention restoration can occur. Only the confidence that you&rsquo;re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting&#160;less&#160;done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.</p>

<p>To succeed with this strategy, you must first accept the commitment that once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.&#160;This includes, crucially, checking e-mail, as well as browsing work-related websites. In both cases, even a brief intrusion of work can generate a self-reinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages described earlier for a long time to follow&#160;(most people are familiar, for example, with the experience of glancing at an alarming e-mail on a Saturday morning and then having its implications haunt your thoughts for the rest of the weekend). &#8230;support your commitment to shutting down with a strict&#160;shutdown ritual&#160;that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it&rsquo;s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you&rsquo;re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, &ldquo;Shutdown complete&rdquo;). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it&rsquo;s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><strong>the Zeigarnik effect.</strong> This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t need to&#160;complete&#160;a task to get it off our minds.&#160;&#8230; In this study, the two researchers began by replicating the Zeigarnik effect in their subjects (in this case, the researchers assigned a task and then cruelly engineered interruptions), but then found that they could significantly reduce the effect&rsquo;s impact by asking the subjects, soon after the interruption, to make a plan for how they would&#160;later&#160;complete the incomplete task.</p>

<h3>Rule #2 Embrace Boredom</h3>

<p>[a story about Adam Marlin, a member of the Knesses Yisroel congregation, and his intense intellectual effort to study the Talmud as a daily morning practice]</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve recently been making&#160;more highly creative insights in my business life,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s related to this daily mental practice. This consistent strain has built my mental muscle over years and years. This was not the goal when I started, but it is the effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8230;&#160;The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. [skill vs habit] In my experience, it&rsquo;s common to treat undistracted concentration as a&#160;habit&#160;like flossing&mdash;something that you know how to do and know is good for you, but that you&rsquo;ve been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-set is appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from distracted to focused overnight if you can simply muster enough motivation. But this understanding ignores the difficulty of focus and the hours of practice necessary to strengthen your &ldquo;mental muscle.&rdquo; The creative insights that Adam Marlin now experiences in his professional life, in other words, have little to do with a onetime decision to think deeper, and much to do with a commitment to training this ability early every morning.</p>

<p>[meditation is a skill, not a habit! - that's why it is so hard for me to do it]</p>

<p>Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don&rsquo;t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.</p>

<p>&#8230;If every moment of potential boredom in your life&mdash;say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives&mdash;is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the &ldquo;mental wrecks&rdquo; in Nass&rsquo;s research, it&rsquo;s not ready for deep work&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely&#160;and&#160;overcoming your desire for distraction.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.</p>

<p>&#8230;Once you&rsquo;re wired for distraction, you crave it.</p>

<p>&#8230;a popular suggestion for distraction addiction that doesn&rsquo;t quite solve our problem: the Internet Sabbath (sometimes called a digital detox). In its basic form, this ritual asks you to put aside regular time&mdash;typically, one day a week&mdash;where you refrain from network technology.</p>

<p>If you eat healthy just one day a week, you&rsquo;re unlikely to lose weight, as the majority of your time is still spent gorging. Similarly, if you spend just one day a week resisting distraction, you&rsquo;re unlikely to diminish your brain&rsquo;s craving for these stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in to it. I propose an alternative to the Internet Sabbath. Instead of scheduling the occasional break&#160;from distraction&#160;so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break&#160;from focus&#160;to give in to distraction. (scheduling Internet blocks)</p>

<p>&#8230;the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain&rsquo;s ability to focus. It&rsquo;s instead the constant&#160;switching&#160;from&#160;low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.&#160;</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you&rsquo;re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics.</p>

<p>&#8230;&#160;you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it&rsquo;s incredibly valuable.</p>

<h3>Work Like Teddy Roosevelt</h3>

<p>This strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your own workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that&rsquo;s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you&rsquo;d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that&#160;drastically reduces&#160;this time. </p>

<p>At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time:&#160;working with great intensity&mdash;no e-mail breaks, no daydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.</p>

<p>The main motivation for this strategy is straightforward. Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable. Roosevelt dashes leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve&mdash;providing, in some sense, interval training for the attention centers of your brain. An additional benefit is that these dashes are incompatible with distraction (there&rsquo;s no way you can give&#160;in to distraction and still make your deadlines).</p>

<p>After a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of what it means to focus will likely be transformed as you reach levels of intensity stronger than anything you&rsquo;ve experienced before.&#160;</p>

<h3>Meditate Productively</h3>

<p>The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you&rsquo;re occupied physically but not mentally&mdash;walking, jogging, driving, showering&mdash;and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.</p>

<p>I ended up, for example, working out the chapter outlines for a significant portion of my last book while on foot, and made progress on many knotty technical problems in my academic research.</p>

<p>In fact, you might even consider scheduling a walk during your workday specifically for the purpose of applying productive meditation to your most pressing problem at the moment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not, however, suggesting this practice for its productivity benefits (though they&rsquo;re nice). I&rsquo;m instead interested in its ability to rapidly improve your ability to think deeply.</p>

<p><b>Suggestion #1:</b> Be Wary of Distractions and Looping</p>

<p>When faced with a hard problem, your mind, as it was evolved to do, will attempt to avoid excess expenditure of energy when possible. One way it might attempt to sidestep this expenditure is by avoiding diving deeper into the problem by instead looping over and over again on what you already know about it.&#160;</p>

<p><b>Suggestion #2:</b> Structure Your Deep Thinking</p>

<p>I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant&#160;variables&#160;for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory. For example, if you&rsquo;re working on the outline for a book chapter, the relevant variables might be the main points you want to make in the chapter.</p>

<p>Once the relevant variables are identified, define the specific&#160;next-step question&#160;you need to answer using these variables. In the book chapter example, this next-step question might be, &ldquo;How am I going to effectively open this chapter&rdquo;&#8230;</p>

<p>ssuming you&rsquo;re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to&#160;consolidate&#160;your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. At this point, you can push yourself to the next level of depth by starting the process over.</p>

<h3> Rule #3 Quit Social Media</h3>

<p>In 2013, author and digital media consultant Baratunde Thurston launched an experiment. He decided to disconnect from his online life for twenty-five days: no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a service that awarded him &ldquo;Mayor of the Year&rdquo; in 2011), not even e-mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the end of that first week, the quiet rhythm of my days seemed far less strange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was less stressed about not knowing new things; I felt that I still existed despite not having shared documentary evidence of said existence on the Internet.&rdquo; Thurston struck up conversations with strangers. He&#160;enjoyed food without Instagramming the experience. He bought a bike (&ldquo;turns out it&rsquo;s easier to ride the thing when you&rsquo;re not trying to simultaneously check your Twitter&rdquo;). &ldquo;The end came too soon,&rdquo; Thurston lamented. But he had start-ups to run and books to market, so after the twenty-five days passed, he reluctantly reactivated his online presence.</p>

<p>The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:&#160;You&rsquo;re justified in using a network tool if you can identify&#160;any&#160;possible benefit to its use, or&#160;anything&#160;you might possibly miss out on if you don&rsquo;t use it.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach, of course, is that it ignores all the negatives that come along with the tools in question. These services are engineered to be addictive&mdash;robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals (such as deep work).</p>

<p>I propose that if you&rsquo;re a knowledge worker&mdash;especially one interested in cultivating a deep work habit&mdash;you should treat your tool selection with the same level of care as other skilled workers, such as farmers.</p>

<p>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:&#160;Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.</p>

<h3>Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits</h3>

<blockquote class="important">
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how overly accessible people are. There&rsquo;s a lot of communication in my life that&rsquo;s not enriching, it&rsquo;s impoverishing.&rdquo; </p><p class="author">Michael Lewis</p></blockquote>

<p>The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life. If you have a family, for example, then your personal goals might involve parenting well and running an organized household. In the professional sphere, the details of these goals depend on what you do for a living. In my own work as a professor, for example, I pursue two important goals, one centered on being an effective teacher in the classroom and effective mentor to my graduate students, and another centered on being an effective researcher.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them.&#160; For example, &ldquo;do better research&rdquo; is too general (what does it look like to be &ldquo;doing better research&rdquo;?), while &ldquo;finish paper on broadcast lower bounds in time for upcoming conference submission&rdquo; is too specific (it&rsquo;s a onetime outcome). A good activity in this context would be something like: &ldquo;regularly read and understand the cutting-edge results in my field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>he next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use. For each such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a&#160;substantially positive impact, a&#160;substantially negative impact, or&#160;little impact&#160;on your regular and successful participation in the activity. Now comes the important decision: Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.</p>

<p>Professional Goal: To craft well-written, narrative-driven stories that change the way people understand the world.  &#160; Key Activities Supporting This Goal:  &bull; Research patiently and deeply.  &bull; Write carefully and with purpose.</p>

<p>Personal Goal: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a group of people who are important to me.  &#160; Key Activities Supporting This Goal:  1. Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who are most important to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity).  2. Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making nontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives).   Let&rsquo;s now step back and apply our strategy&rsquo;s filtering logic to the example of Facebook in the context of this personal goal. This service, of course, offers any number of benefits to your social life. To name a few that are often mentioned: It allows you to catch up with people you haven&rsquo;t seen in a while, it allows you to maintain lightweight contact with people you know but don&rsquo;t run into regularly, it allows you to more easily monitor important events in people&rsquo;s lives (such as whether or not they&rsquo;re married or what their new baby looks like), and it allows you to stumble onto online communities or groups that match your interests.</p>

<p>&#8230;Of course Facebook offers benefits to your social life, but none are important enough to what really matters to you in this area to justify giving it access to your time and attention.</p>

<p><strong>The Law of the Vital Few:</strong>&#160;In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.</p>

<p>Assuming that you could probably list somewhere between ten and fifteen distinct and potentially beneficial activities for each of your life goals, this law says that it&rsquo;s the top two or three such activities&mdash;the number&#160;that this strategy asks you to focus on&mdash;that make most of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal.</p>

<p>&#8230;all activities, regardless of their importance, consume your same limited store of time and attention. If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you&rsquo;re taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It&rsquo;s a zero-sum game. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit.</p>

<p>By taking the time consumed by low-impact activities&mdash;like finding old friends on Facebook&mdash;and reinvesting in&#160;high-impact activities&mdash;like taking a good friend out to lunch&mdash;you end up more successful in your goal. To abandon a network tool using this logic, therefore, is not to miss out on its potential small benefits, but is instead to get more out of the activities you already know to yield large benefits.</p>

<h3>Quit Social Media</h3>

<p>In more detail, this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party on the social media services that you currently use. Instead of &ldquo;packing,&rdquo; however, you&rsquo;ll instead ban yourself from using them for&#160;thirty days. All of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine&mdash;or whatever other services have risen to popularity&#160;since I first wrote these words. Don&rsquo;t formally deactivate these services, and (this is important) don&rsquo;t mention online that you&rsquo;ll be signing off: Just stop using them, cold turkey. If someone reaches out to you by other means and asks why your activity on a particular service has fallen off, you can explain, but don&rsquo;t go out of your way to tell people.</p>

<p>After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: 1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? 2. Did people care that I wasn&rsquo;t using this service?</p>

<p>By spending a month without these services, you can replace your fear that you might miss out&mdash;on events, on conversations, on shared cultural experience&mdash;with a dose of reality. For most people this reality will confirm something that seems obvious only once you&rsquo;ve done the hard work of freeing yourself from the marketing messages surrounding these tools: They&rsquo;re not really all that important in your life.</p>

<p>&#8230;I&rsquo;ll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention to what I say&mdash;regardless of its value.&#160;A blog or&#160;magazine or television program that contained the content that typically populates a Facebook wall or Twitter feed, for example, would attract, on average,&#160;no&#160;audience. But when captured within the social conventions of these services, that same content will attract attention in the form of likes and comments. The implicit agreement motivating this behavior is that in return for receiving (for the most part, undeserved) attention from your friends and followers, you&rsquo;ll return the favor by lavishing (similarly undeserved) attention on them.&#160;You &ldquo;like&rdquo; my status update and I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;like&rdquo; yours.&#160;This agreement gives everyone a simulacrum of importance without requiring much effort in return.</p>

<p>These services aren&rsquo;t necessarily, as advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected world. They&rsquo;re just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Take the case of a Londoner who works in an office, whose office hours are from ten to six, and who spends fifty&#160;minutes morning and night in travelling between his house door and his office door,&rdquo; [Arnold] Bennett writes in his 1910 self-help classic,&#160;How to Live on 24 Hours a Day. This hypothetical London salaryman, he notes, has a little more than sixteen hours left in the day beyond these work-related hours. To Bennett, this is a lot of time, but most people in this situation tragically don&rsquo;t realize its potential. The &ldquo;great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day,&rdquo; he elaborates, is that even though he doesn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy his work (seeing it as something to &ldquo;get through&rdquo;), &ldquo;he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as &lsquo;the day,&rsquo; to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue.&rdquo; This is an attitude that Bennett condemns as &ldquo;utterly illogical and unhealthy.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the alternative to this state of affairs? Bennett suggests that his typical man see his sixteen free hours as a &ldquo;day within a day,&rdquo; explaining, &ldquo;during those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income.&rdquo; Accordingly, the typical man should instead use this time as an aristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-improvement&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;entertainment-focused websites designed to capture and hold your attention for as long as possible. &#8230; These sites are especially harmful after the workday is over, where the freedom in your schedule enables them to become central to your leisure time. If you&rsquo;re waiting in line, or waiting for the plot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting to finish eating a meal, they provide a cognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate any chance of boredom.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a hundred years earlier:&#160;Put more thought into your leisure time. In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don&rsquo;t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your &ldquo;day within a day.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial, therefore, that you figure out in advance what you&rsquo;re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.</p>

<p>[Arnold Bennett:] What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change&mdash;not rest, except in sleep. In my experience, this analysis is spot-on. If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughoutall&#160;your waking hours, you&rsquo;ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.</p>

<h3> Rule #4 Drain the Shallows</h3>

<p>Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You&rsquo;re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday. Fewer official working hours helps squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that&rsquo;s a good thing. They don&rsquo;t waste it on things that just don&rsquo;t matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely. -Jason Fried, cofounder of 37signals (now called Basecamp)</p>

<p>Fried had always been interested in the policies of technology companies like Google that gave their employees 20 percent of their time to work on self-directed projects. While he liked this idea, he felt that carving one day out of an otherwise busy week was not enough to support the type of unbroken deep work that generates true breakthroughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take 5 days in a row over 5 days spread out over 5 weeks,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;So our theory is that we&rsquo;ll see better results when people have a long stretch of uninterrupted time.&rdquo; To test this theory, 37signals implemented something radical: The company gave its employees the&#160;entire month of June&#160;off to work deeply on their own projects.&#160;</p>

<p>Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. Performance psychologists have extensively studied how much such efforts can be sustained by an individual in a given day. In their seminal paper on deliberate practice, Anders Ericsson and his collaborators survey these studies. They note that for someone new to such practice (citing, in particular, a child in the early stages of developing an expert-level skill), an hour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such activities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.</p>

<h4>Schedule Every Minute of Your Day</h4>

<p>(Time blocking)</p>

<p>&#8230;someone following this&#160;combination of comprehensive scheduling and a willingness to adapt or modify the plan as needed will likely experience&#160;more&#160;creative insights than someone who adopts a more traditionally &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; approach where the day is left open and unstructured. Without structure, it&rsquo;s easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow&mdash;e-mail, social media, Web surfing. This type of shallow behavior, though satisfying in the moment, is not conducive to creativity. With structure, on the other hand, you can ensure that you regularly schedule blocks to grapple with a new idea, or work deeply on something challenging, or brainstorm for a fixed period&mdash;the type of commitment more likely to instigate innovation.</p>

<p>&#8230;you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.</p>

<h4>Quantify the Depth of Every Activity</h4>

<p>How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?</p>

<h4>Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget</h4>

<p>What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?&#160;</p>

<p>For most people in most non-entry-level knowledge work jobs, the answer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent range&#8230;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll almost certainly end up forced into saying no to projects that seem infused with shallowness while also more aggressively reducing the amount of shallowness in your existing projects.</p>

<p>&#8230;part of the reason shallow work persists in large quantities in knowledge work is that we rarely see the total impact of such efforts on our schedules. ... You can now confidently say to your boss, &ldquo;This is the exact percentage of my time spent last week on shallow work,&rdquo; and force him or her to give explicit approval for that ratio. Faced with these numbers, and the economic reality they clarify (it&rsquo;s incredibly wasteful, for example, to pay a highly trained professional to send e-mail messages and attend meetings for thirty hours a week), a boss will be led to the natural conclusion that you&#160;need&#160;to say no to some things and to streamline others&mdash;even if this makes life less convenient for the boss, or for you, or for your coworkers. Because, of course, in the end, a business&rsquo;s goal is to generate value, not to make sure its employees&rsquo; lives are as easy as possible.</p>

<p>If you work for yourself, this exercise will force you to confront the reality of how little time in your &ldquo;busy&rdquo; schedule you&rsquo;re actually producing value. These hard numbers will provide you the confidence needed to start scaling back on the shallow activities that are sapping your time. Without these numbers, it&rsquo;s difficult for an entrepreneur to say no to&#160;any opportunity that&#160;might&#160;generate some positive return. &ldquo;I have to be on Twitter!,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have to maintain an active Facebook presence!,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have to tweak the widgets on my blog!,&rdquo; you tell yourself, because when considered in isolation, to say no to any one of these activities seems like you&rsquo;re being lazy.</p>

<p>&#8230;a job that doesn&rsquo;t support deep work is not a job that can help you succeed in our current information economy.</p>

<h4>Finish Your Work by Five Thirty</h4>

<p>I call this commitment&#160;fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.</p>

<p>I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most dangerous word in one&rsquo;s productivity vocabulary: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; It takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work. If you ask for my involvement in university business that&rsquo;s not absolutely necessary, I might respond with a defense I learned from the department chair who hired me: &ldquo;Talk to me after tenure.&rdquo; Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I turn down a time-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I have other trips scheduled for around the same time, I don&rsquo;t provide details&mdash;which might leave the requester the ability to suggest a way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations&mdash;but instead just say, &ldquo;Sounds interesting, but&#160;I can&rsquo;t make it due to schedule conflicts.&rdquo; In turning down obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almost as much of my schedule (e.g., &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t join your committee, but I&rsquo;m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they come together and offer my thoughts&rdquo;). A clean break is best.</p>

<p>&#8230;the reduction in shallow frees up&#160;more&#160;energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule.</p>

<p>In most knowledge work jobs, it can be difficult in the moment to turn down a shallow commitment that seems harmless in isolation&mdash;be it accepting an invitation to get coffee or agreeing to &ldquo;jump on a call.&rdquo; A commitment to fixed-schedule productivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly any obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially disruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to your time and attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the efforts that pass these obstacles with a ruthless efficiency.</p>

<h4>Become Hard to Reach</h4>

<p><b>Tip #2:</b> Do More Work When&#160;You&#160;Send or Reply to E-mails</p>

<p>What is the&#160;project&#160;represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated)&#160;process&#160;for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?</p>

<p>Notice, the word &ldquo;project&rdquo; is used loosely here. It can cover things that are large and obviously projects, such as making progress on a research problem (Example #2), but it applies just as easily to small logistical challenges like setting up a coffee meeting (Example #1). I then took a minute or two to think through a process that gets us from the current state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages required. The final step was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and where we stand.</p>

<p>&#8230; process-centric messages can seem stilted and overly technical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail promote a conversational tone that clashes with the more systematic schedules or decision trees commonly used in process-centric communication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer conversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the process-centric portion of the message from the conversational opening with a divider line, or label it &ldquo;Proposed Next Steps,&rdquo; so that its technical tone seems more appropriate in context.</p>

<p><b>Tip #3:</b> Don&rsquo;t Respond</p>

<p>&#8230;When it comes to e-mail, they believed, it&rsquo;s the sender&rsquo;s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. If you didn&rsquo;t make a convincing case&#160;and&#160;sufficiently&#160;minimize the effort required by the professor to respond, you didn&rsquo;t get a response.</p>

<p>Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies: &bull; It&rsquo;s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response. &bull; It&rsquo;s not a question or proposal that interests you. &bull; Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>As the author Tim Ferriss once wrote: &ldquo;Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll never find time for the life-changing big things.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>To leave the distracted masses to join the focused few, I&rsquo;m arguing, is a transformative experience.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you&rsquo;re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live the focused life, because it&rsquo;s the best kind there is.&rdquo; -Winifred Gallaghe </p>
