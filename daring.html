<p>Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, <i>No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough.</i> It's going to bed at night thinking, <i>Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.</i></p>

<p>If you roughly divide the men and women I've interviewed into two groups -those who feel a deep sense of love and belonging, and those who struggle for it - there's only one variable that separates the groups: Those who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply believe they are <i>worthy</i> of love and belonging. They don't have better or easier lives, they don't have fewer struggles with addiction or depression, and they haven't survived fewer traumas or bankruptcies or divorces, but in the midst of all of these struggles, they have developed practices that enable them to hold on to the belief that they are worthy of love, belonging, and even joy.</p>
<p>A strong belief in our worthiness doesn't just happen - it's cultivated when we understand the guideposts as choices and daily practices.</p>

<p>They attribute everything -from their professional success to their marriages to their proudest parenting moments - to their ability to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>Vulnerability is the core, the heart, the center, of meaningful human experiences.</p>

<p>If we want to reignite innovation and passion, we have to rehumanize work... When failure is not an option we can forget about learning, creativity, and innovation.</p>

<p>The mandate is not to be perfect and raise happy children. Perfection doesn't exist, and I've found that what makes children happy doesn't always prepare them to be courageous, engaged adults.</p>

<p>What we know matters, but who we are matters more. Being rather than knowing requires showing up and letting ourselves be seen. It requires us to dare greatly, to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>For example, when I look at narcissism through the vulnerability lens, I see the shame-based fear of being ordinary. I see the fear of never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be lovable, to belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose. Sometimes the simple act of humanizing problems sheds an important light on them, a light that often goes out the minute a stigmatizing label is applied.</p>

<p>I see the cultural messaging everywhere that says that an ordinary life is a meaningless life. And I see how kids that grow up on a steady diet of reality television, celebrity culture, and unsupervised social media can absorb this messaging and develop a completely skewed sense of the world.<i>I am only as good as the number of <q>likes</q> I get on Facebook or Instagram.</i></p>

<p>I know the yearning to believe that what I'm doing matters and how easy it is to confuse that with the drive to be extraordinary. I know how seductive it is to use the celebrity culture yardstick to measure the smallness of our lives. And I also understand how grandiosity, entitlement, and admiration-seeking feel like just the right balm to soothe the ache of being too ordinary and inadequate. Yes, these thoughts and behaviors ultimately cause more pain and lead to more disconnection, but when we're hurting and when love and belonging are hanging in the balance, we reach for what we think will offer us the most protection.</p>

<p>...Lynne Twist. In her book<cite>The Soul of Money</cite>, she refers to scarcity as <q>the great lie.</q> She writes:<br/>
<blockquote>For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is <q>I didn't get enough sleep.</q> The next one is <q>I don't have enough time.</q> Whether true or not, that thought of<i>not enough</i>occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don't have enough of... Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we're already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn't get, or didn't get done, that day. We go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack... This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life...</blockquote></p>

<p>What makes this constant assessing and comparing so self-defeating is that we are often comparing our lives, our marriages, our families, and our communities to unattainable, media-driven visions of perfection, or we're holding up our reality against our own fictional account of how great someone else has it. Nostalgia is also a dangerous form of comparison. Think about how often we compare ourselves and our lives to a memory that nostalgia has so completely edited that it never really existed: <q>Remember when...? Those were the days...</q><blockquote>
