            <h3>INTRODUCTION<br/>
                MY ADVENTURES IN THE ARENA</h3>

            <p>Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the
                courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, <i>No matter what gets done and
                    how much is left undone, I am enough.</i> It's going to bed at night thinking, <i>Yes, I am
                    imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn't change the truth that I am also
                    brave and worthy of love and belonging.</i></p>

            <p>If you roughly divide the men and women I've interviewed into two groups -those who feel a deep sense of
                love and belonging, and those who struggle for it - there's only one variable that separates the groups:
                Those who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply believe they are <i>worthy</i> of
                love and belonging. They don't have better or easier lives, they don't have fewer struggles with
                addiction or depression, and they haven't survived fewer traumas or bankruptcies or divorces, but in the
                midst of all of these struggles, they have developed practices that enable them to hold on to the belief
                that they are worthy of love, belonging, and even joy.</p>
            <p>A strong belief in our worthiness doesn't just happen - it's cultivated when we understand the guideposts
                as choices and daily practices.</p>

            <p>They attribute everything -from their professional success to their marriages to their proudest parenting
                moments - to their ability to be vulnerable.</p>

            <p>Vulnerability is the core, the heart, the center, of meaningful human experiences.</p>

            <p>If we want to reignite innovation and passion, we have to rehumanize work... When failure is not an
                option we can forget about learning, creativity, and innovation.</p>

            <p>The mandate is not to be perfect and raise happy children. Perfection doesn't exist, and I've found that
                what makes children happy doesn't always prepare them to be courageous, engaged adults.</p>

            <p><i>What we know matters, but who we are matters more.</i> Being rather than knowing requires showing up
                and
                letting ourselves be seen. It requires us to dare greatly, to be vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>CHAPTER 1<br/>
                SCARCITY: LOOKING INSIDE OUR CULTURE OF “NEVER ENOUGH”</h3>

            <p>For example, when I look at narcissism through the vulnerability lens, I see the shame-based fear of
                being ordinary. I see the fear of never feeling extraordinary enough to be noticed, to be lovable, to
                belong, or to cultivate a sense of purpose. Sometimes the simple act of humanizing problems sheds an
                important light on them, a light that often goes out the minute a stigmatizing label is applied.</p>

            <p>I see the cultural messaging everywhere that says that an ordinary life is a meaningless life. And I see
                how kids that grow up on a steady diet of reality television, celebrity culture, and unsupervised social
                media can absorb this messaging and develop a completely skewed sense of the world.<i>I am only as good
                    as the number of <q>likes</q> I get on Facebook or Instagram.</i></p>

            <p>I know the yearning to believe that what I'm doing matters and how easy it is to confuse that with the
                drive to be extraordinary. I know how seductive it is to use the celebrity culture yardstick to measure
                the smallness of our lives. And I also understand how grandiosity, entitlement, and admiration-seeking
                feel like just the right balm to soothe the ache of being too ordinary and inadequate. Yes, these
                thoughts and behaviors ultimately cause more pain and lead to more disconnection, but when we're hurting
                and when love and belonging are hanging in the balance, we reach for what we think will offer us the
                most protection.</p>

            <p>...Lynne Twist. In her book<cite>The Soul of Money</cite>, she refers to scarcity as <q>the great
                lie.</q> She writes:</p>
            <blockquote>For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is <q>I didn't get enough
                sleep.</q> The next one is <q>I don't have enough time.</q> Whether true or not, that thought of <i>not
                enough</i> occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. We spend most of
                the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don't
                have enough of... Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we're already
                inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at
                night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn't get, or didn't get done, that day. We go to
                sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack... This internal condition of
                scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our
                prejudice, and our arguments with life...
            </blockquote>

            <p>What makes this constant assessing and comparing so self-defeating is that we are often comparing our
                lives, our marriages, our families, and our communities to unattainable, media-driven visions of
                perfection, or we're holding up our reality against our own fictional account of how great someone else
                has it. Nostalgia is also a dangerous form of comparison. Think about how often we compare ourselves and
                our lives to a memory that nostalgia has so completely edited that it never really existed: <q>Remember
                    when...? Those were the days...</q>
            </p>

            <h3>CHAPTER 2<br>
                DEBUNKING THE VULNERABILITY MYTHS</h3>

            <h4>Myth #1: “Vulnerability is weakness”</h4>

            <p><strong>I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.</strong> With that
                definition in
                mind, let’s think about love. Waking up every day and loving someone who may or may not love us back,
                whose
                safety we can’t ensure, who may stay in our lives or may leave without a moment’s notice, who may be
                loyal
                to the day they die or betray us tomorrow—that’s vulnerability. Love is uncertain. It’s incredibly
                risky.
                And loving someone leaves us emotionally exposed. Yes, it’s scary and yes, we’re open to being hurt, but
                can
                you imagine your life without loving or being loved?</p>
            <p>To let ourselves sink into the joyful moments of our lives even though we know that they are fleeting,
                even
                though the world tells us not to be too happy lest we invite disaster—that’s an intense form of
                vulnerability.
            </p>
            <p>Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but
                they’re never weakness.
            </p>
            <p>They found that the participants who thought they were not susceptible or vulnerable to deceptive
                advertising
                were, in fact, the most vulnerable. The researchers’ explanation for this phenomenon says it
                all: <strong>
                    “Far from being an effective shield, the illusion of invulnerability undermines the very response
                    that
                    would have supplied genuine protection.”</strong>
            </p>
            <p>First I asked, “How many of you struggle to be vulnerable because you think of vulnerability as
                weakness?”
                Hands shot up across the room. Then I asked, “When you watched people on this stage being vulnerable,
                how
                many of you thought it was courageous?” Again, hands shot up across the room.
                We love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we’re afraid to let them see it in us. We’re
                afraid that our truth isn’t enough—that what we have to offer isn’t enough without the bells and
                whistles,
                without editing, and impressing.
            </p>
            <p>As I walked up to the stage, I literally whispered aloud, <em>“What’s worth doing even if I fail?”</em>
            </p>
            <p>The willingness to show up changes us. It makes us a little braver each time.
            </p>
            <p>From calling a friend who’s experienced a terrible tragedy to starting your own business, from feeling
                terrified to experiencing liberation, vulnerability is life’s great dare. It’s life asking, “Are you all
                in?
                Can you value your own vulnerability as much as you value it in others?” Answering yes to these
                questions is
                not weakness: It’s courage beyond measure. It’s daring greatly.

            <h4>Myth #2: “I don't do vulnerability”</h4>

            <p>Unfortunately, there is no “get out of vulnerability free” card. We can’t opt out of the uncertainty,
                risk, and emotional exposure that’s woven through our daily experiences. Life is vulnerable.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we pretend that we can avoid vulnerability we engage in behaviors that are often inconsistent with
                who
                we want to be. Experiencing vulnerability isn’t a choice—the only choice we have is how we’re going to
                respond when we are confronted with uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.
            </p>

            <h4>Myth #3: Vulnerability is letting it all hang out</h4>

            <p>
                Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It’s not oversharing, it’s not
                purging, it’s not indiscriminate disclosure, and it’s not celebrity-style social media information
                dumps.
                <em>Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the
                    right
                    to hear them.</em> Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building
                process.
            </p>

            <p>
                We don’t lead with “Hi, my name is Brené, and here’s my darkest struggle.” That’s not vulnerability.
                That may
                be desperation or woundedness or even attention-seeking, but it’s not vulnerability. Why? Because <em>sharing
                appropriately, with boundaries, means sharing with people with whom we’ve developed relationships that
                can bear the weight of our story.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                And the TMI (too much information) issue is not even a case of “too much vulnerability”—vulnerability is
                bankrupt on its own terms when people move from being vulnerable to using vulnerability to deal with
                unmet
                needs, get attention, or engage in the shock-and-awe behaviors that are so commonplace in today’s
                culture.
            </p>

            <p>
                I told Ellen <em>to think about her friendships as marble jars.</em> Whenever someone supports you, or
                is
                kind to you, or sticks up for you, or honors what you share with them as private, you put marbles in the
                jar.
                When people are mean, or disrespectful, or share your secrets, marbles come out. When I asked her if it
                made sense,
                she nodded her head with excitement and said, “I’ve got marble jar friends! I’ve got marble jar
                friends!”
            </p>

            <blockquote class="important">
                <p>What I’ve found through research is that trust is built in very small moments, which I call “sliding
                    door”
                    moments, after the movie <cite>Sliding Doors</cite>. In any interaction, there is a possibility of
                    connecting with your partner or turning away from your partner.<br>
                    Let me give you an example of that from my own relationship. One night, I really wanted to finish a
                    mystery novel. I thought I knew who the killer was, but I was anxious to find out. At one point in
                    the
                    night, I put the novel on my bedside and walked into the bathroom.<br>
                    As I passed the mirror, I saw my wife’s face in the reflection, and she looked sad, brushing her
                    hair.
                    There was a sliding door moment.<br>
                    I had a choice. I could sneak out of the bathroom and think, I don’t want to deal with her sadness
                    tonight; I want to read my novel. But instead, because I’m a sensitive researcher of relationships,
                    I decided to go into the bathroom. I took the brush from her hair and asked, “What’s the matter,
                    baby?”
                    And she told me why she was sad.<br>
                    Now, at that moment, I was building trust; I was there for her. I was connecting with her rather
                    than
                    choosing to think only about what I wanted. These are the moments, we’ve discovered, that build
                    trust.
                    One such moment is not that important, but if you’re always choosing to turn away, then trust erodes
                    in
                    a relationship—very gradually, very slowly.</p>
                <p class="author">John Gottman, <cite>The Science of Trust: Emotional Attunement for Couples</cite></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                <em>…the betrayal of disengagement. Of not caring. Of letting the connection go. Of not being willing to
                    devote time and effort to the relationship.</em> The word betrayal evokes experiences of cheating,
                lying,
                breaking a confidence, failing to defend us to someone else who’s gossiping about us, and not choosing
                us
                over other people. These behaviors are certainly betrayals, but they’re not the only form of betrayal.
            </p>

            <p>
                When the people we love or with whom we have a deep connection stop caring, stop paying attention, stop
                investing, and stop fighting for the relationship, trust begins to slip away and hurt starts seeping in.
                Disengagement triggers shame and our greatest fears—the fears of being abandoned, unworthy, and
                unlovable.
                What can make this covert betrayal so much more dangerous than something like a lie or an affair is that
                we
                can’t point to the source of our pain—there’s no event, no obvious evidence of brokenness.
            </p>

                Or at work, we think, <cite>Why am I not getting feedback? Tell me you love it! Tell me it sucks! Just
                tell
                me something so I know you remember that I work here!</cite>
            </p>

            <h4>Myth #4: We can go it all alone</h4>

            <p>Most of us are good at giving help, but when it comes to vulnerability, we need to ask for help too.</p>

            <p>Vulnerability begets vulnerability; courage is contagious.</p>

            <p>…when I loved so fiercely that rather than feeling gratitude and joy I could only prepare for loss…</p>

            <p>
                I learned how to set new boundaries and say no, even when I was terrified that I was going to piss off a
                friend or squander a professional opportunity that I’d regret. So far, I haven’t regretted a single no.
            </p>

            <p>
                Going back to Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena” speech, I also learned that the people who love me, the
                people I
                really depend on, were never the critics who were pointing at me while I stumbled. They weren’t in the
                bleachers at all. They were with me in the arena. Fighting for me and with me.
            </p>

            <p>
                We simply can’t learn to be more vulnerable and courageous on our own. Sometimes our first and greatest
                dare
                is asking for support.

                UNDERSTANDING AND COMBATING SHAME</h3>

            <h3>CHAPTER 4<br>
                THE VULNERABILITY ARMORY</h3>

            <p>
                Masks make us feel safer even when they become suffocating. Armor makes us feel stronger even when we
                grow
                weary from dragging the extra weight around. The irony is that when we’re standing across from someone
                who
                is hidden or shielded by masks and armor, we feel frustrated and disconnected. That’s the paradox
                here: <i>Vulnerability is the last thing I want you to see in me, but the first thing I look for in
                you.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                …armor can be hard to see on adults. Once we’ve worn it long enough, it molds to our shape and is
                ultimately
                undetectable—it’s like a second skin. Masks are the same way. I’ve interviewed hundreds of participants
                who
                have conveyed the same fear: “I can’t take the mask off now—no one knows what I really look like. Not my
                partner, not my kids, not my friends. They’ve never met the real me. I’m not even sure who I am under
                here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                From my personal experiences, I can tell you that the most difficult thing about parenting a daughter in
                middle school is coming face-to-face with the awkward, sweaty-palmed seventh-grader who lives inside me.
                My
                instinct back then was to duck and run, and I often feel that impulse creeping up on me when Ellen is in
                a
                struggle.

            <h4>The “Enough” Mandate</h4>

            <p>
                This lay at the core of every strategy illuminated by the research participants for freeing themselves
                from their armor:
            </p>
            <div class="important">
                <ul class="detail-list">
                    <li>I am enough (worthiness versus shame).</li>
                    <li>I’ve had enough (boundaries versus one-uping and comparison).</li>
                    <li>Showing up, taking risks, and letting myself be seen is enough (engagement versus
                        disengagement).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>The Shield: Foreboding Joy</h4>
            <p>
                …I’d argue that joy is probably the most difficult emotion to really feel. Why? Because when we lose the
                ability or willingness to be vulnerable, joy becomes something we approach with deep foreboding.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a culture of deep scarcity—of never feeling safe, certain, and sure enough—joy can feel like a setup.
                We wake up in the morning and think, <i>Work is going well. Everyone in the family is healthy. No major
                crises are happening. The house is still standing. I’m working out and feeling good. Oh, shit. This is
                bad. This is really bad. Disaster must be lurking right around the corner.</i><br>
                Or we get promoted, and our first thought is <i>Too good to be true. What’s the catch?</i>
                We find out we’re pregnant, and we think, <i>Our daughter is healthy and happy, so something really bad
                is going to happen with this baby. I just know it.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                When I started asking participants about the experiences that left them feeling the most vulnerable, I
                didn’t expect joy to be one of the answers. I expected fear and shame, but not the joyful moments of
                their lives. I was shocked to hear people say they were at their most vulnerable when:
            </p>
            <div class="important">
                <ul class="detail-list">
                    <li>Standing over my children while they’re sleeping</li>
                    <li>Acknowledging how much I love my husband/wife</li>
                    <li>Knowing how good I’ve got it</li>
                    <li>Loving my job</li>
                    <li>Spending time with my parents</li>
                    <li>Watching my parents with my children</li>
                    <li>Getting engaged</li>
                    <li>Having a baby</li>
                    <li>Getting promoted</li>
                    <li>Being happy</li>
                    <li>Falling in love</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                “I used to take every good thing and imagine the worst possible disaster,” she told me. “I would
                literally
                picture the worst-case scenario and try to control all of the outcomes. When my daughter got into the
                college of her dreams, I just knew something bad would happen if she moved too far away. I spent the
                entire
                summer before she left trying to convince her to go to a local school. It crushed her confidence and
                took
                the fun out of our last summer. ... Unfortunately, I’ve passed that way of thinking down to my daughter.
                She’s increasingly afraid to try new things, especially when her life is going well. She says she
                doesn’t
                want to &lsquo;tempt fate.&rsquo;”
            </p>
            <p>
                A man in his early sixties told me, “I used to think the best way to go through life was to expect the
                worst. That way, if it happened, you were prepared, and if it didn’t happen, you were pleasantly
                surprised.
                Then I was in a car accident and my wife was killed. Needless to say, expecting the worst didn’t prepare
                me
                at all. And worse, <em>I still grieve for all of those wonderful moments we shared and that I didn’t
                fully
                enjoy.</em> My commitment to her is to fully enjoy every moment now. I just wish she was here, now that
                I know
                how to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                …the concept of foreboding joy as a method of minimizing vulnerability is best understood as a continuum
                that runs from “rehearsing tragedy” to what I call “perpetual disappointment.” …
                What the perpetual-disappointment folks described is this: “It’s easier to live disappointed than it is
                to feel disappointed. It feels more vulnerable to dip in and out of disappointment than to just set up
                camp there. You sacrifice joy, but you suffer less pain.”
            </p>
            <p>
                If, like me, you’ve ever stood over your children and thought to yourself, <i>I love you so much I can
                barely breathe,</i> and in that exact moment have been flooded with images of something terrible
                happening
                to your child, know that you’re not crazy nor are you alone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re desperate for more joy, but at the same time we can’t tolerate the vulnerability.
            </p>
            <h4>Daring Greatly: Practicing Gratitude</h4>
            <p>
                For those welcoming the experience, the shudder of vulnerability that accompanies joy is an invitation
                to practice gratitude, to <em>acknowledge how truly grateful we are for the person, the beauty, the
                connection, or simply the moment before us.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also startled by the fact that research participants consistently described <em>both joyfulness and
                gratitude as spiritual practices that were bound to a belief in human connectedness and a power greater
                than us.</em> Their stories and descriptions expanded on this, pointing to a clear distinction between
                happiness and joy. Participants described happiness as an emotion that’s connected to circumstances, and
                they described <em>joy as a spiritual way of engaging with the world that’s connected to practicing
                gratitude.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Scarcity and fear drive foreboding joy. We’re afraid that the feeling of joy won’t last, or that there
                won’t be enough, or that the transition to disappointment (or whatever is in store for us next) will be
                too difficult. We’ve learned that giving in to joy is, at best, setting ourselves up for disappointment
                and, at worst, inviting disaster. And we struggle with the worthiness issue. Do we deserve our joy,
                given our inadequacies and imperfections? What about the starving children and the war-ravaged world?
                Who are we to be joyful?
            </p>
            <p>
                I use the word <b>practicing</b> because the research participants spoke of tangible gratitude
                practices, more than merely having an attitude of gratitude or feeling grateful. In fact, they gave
                specific examples of gratitude practices that included everything from keeping gratitude journals and
                gratitude jars to implementing family gratitude rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
                …I learned the most about gratitude practices and the relationship between scarcity and joy that plays
                out in vulnerability from the men and women who had experienced some of the most profound losses or
                survived the greatest traumas. These included parents whose children had died, family members with
                terminally ill loved ones, and genocide and trauma survivors.

                        to you. When you honor what you have, you’re honoring what I’ve lost.
